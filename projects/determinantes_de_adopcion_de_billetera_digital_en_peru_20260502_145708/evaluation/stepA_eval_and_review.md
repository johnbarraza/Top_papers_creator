## EVALUATION

---

### 1. Research Question Clarity — 7/10

The question is well-posed at face value: a specific cutoff, a clear running variable, a measurable outcome. The causal claim is explicit. However, two issues blunt the score:

- **Conflation of eligibility and receipt**: Pensión 65 is not universally assigned at age 65. It is means-tested (SISFOH poverty classification), requires no overlapping pension (AFP/ONP), and has geographic targeting. "Crossing the age-65 threshold" is not the same as "receiving the transfer digitally." The question as written overstates what the RDD can identify.
- **Rural heterogeneity is raised in the mechanism but not formalized**. If this is a core claim, it needs to appear as a pre-specified subgroup analysis, not a sentence in the hypothesis block.

---

### 2. Identification Strategy — 5/10

**Source of Exogenous Variation**: The age-65 cutoff for Pensión 65 eligibility. Conceptually clean — age is not chosen strategically in continuous time, and the program's legal threshold creates a discontinuity in eligibility probability.

**Critical Misspecification — Sharp vs. Fuzzy**:
The proposal designates this as a *sharp* RDD. That is incorrect. Pensión 65 requires age ≥ 65 AND extreme poverty (SISFOH) AND no active pension. The probability of treatment jumps discontinuously at age 65 but does not reach 1. This is by definition a **fuzzy RDD**. Treating it as sharp conflates the Intent-to-Treat estimate with a LATE. The correct specification uses age as the instrument for program receipt, not as direct assignment. This is not a minor labeling error — it changes the estimand and the standard errors.

**Identification Tier**: Tier 2 (fuzzy RDD) if corrected. As currently specified (misclassified as sharp), the estimates would be attenuated and the design would be misrepresented to referees.

**Additional threats to the RDD continuity assumption**:

1. **Cross-sectional cohort confounds** (HIGH): In a cross-section, people aged 64 vs. 66 are different birth cohorts. Cohort-specific exposure to smartphones, digital literacy trends, or prior financial inclusion programs could create a spurious jump at age 65 unrelated to Pensión 65. RDD continuity requires that potential outcomes are smooth through the cutoff — with a cross-section, this assumption is far harder to defend than with panel data.

2. **Competing discontinuities at age 65** (MEDIUM): AFP/ONP formal retirement eligibility ages cluster near 65 in Peru. If other entitlements or behavioral changes (retirement itself, reduced labor income) also activate near 65, the estimated jump is not attributable solely to Pensión 65 receipt.

3. **Age heaping / soft manipulation** (MEDIUM): Rural Peru has documented age misreporting in administrative records. McCrary test is appropriate and proposed — but age heaping at round numbers (especially 60, 65, 70) can pass a standard McCrary test while still violating the no-manipulation assumption locally at the cutoff.

The McCrary test and CCT bandwidth selection are appropriate tools. The rdrobust call is standard. The visual inspection of year-by-year adoption rates is good practice. The bones of the design are sound — but the sharp/fuzzy misspecification and the cohort confound are not cosmetic problems.

### 3. Data Feasibility — 7/10

ENAHO is real, publicly available, and well-suited for this type of analysis. N=117K is large; density around age 65 will be more than adequate for CCT bandwidth selection.

Key gaps:

- **Year(s) unspecified**: "Time coverage: unknown" is a red flag. ENAHO financial modules change across waves. Digital wallet adoption (Yape, Plin) became measurable in Peru only around 2019–2021. Using a pre-2018 wave would find essentially zero adoption at any age, making the outcome trivially uninformative. The proposal must pin down which ENAHO edition(s) contain a usable digital wallet variable.
- **Outcome variable verification**: The proposal assumes ENAHO contains a digital wallet adoption variable. This needs confirmation — ENAHO covers general financial inclusion but the specific "billetera digital" item may require checking module availability by year.
- **First-stage validation**: Linking ENAHO to MIDIS district coverage is methodologically sensible for the fuzzy first stage, but this linkage is described as "supplementary" — it should be core to the design if the RDD is correctly specified as fuzzy.

### 4. Novelty & Contribution — 6/10

The forced-inclusion-via-transfers literature is active and has strong anchor papers (Bachas et al. 2021 QJE on Mexico; Muralidharan et al. 2016 AER on India Smartcard). The Peru-specific angle on Pensión 65, the RDD identification, and the focus on *digital wallets specifically* (rather than bank accounts or debit cards) represent a genuine incremental contribution. The elderly rural population is an underexplored margin. This is not transformative — it is one well-executed country study in a growing multi-country literature — but that is a reasonable target for a field paper.

---

### 5. Policy Relevance / Impact — 8/10

High. MIDIS and MEF are actively debating whether digitizing Pensión 65 payments drives lasting adoption or merely transactional compliance. This question has a direct operational counterpart. Results are transferable to similar programs across Latin America (Colombia's Colombia Mayor, Mexico's Sembrando Vida). The elderly rural margin is exactly where policymakers face the hardest inclusion challenge.

### 6. Threats to Validity

| Threat | Severity | Addressed? |
|---|---|---|
| Sharp RDD misspecification (program is means-tested; age 65 ≠ deterministic assignment) | HIGH | NO — proposal calls this sharp without justification |
| Cross-sectional cohort confounds (age 64 vs. 66 are different birth cohorts in cross-section) | HIGH | NO — not mentioned |
| Competing age discontinuities near 65 (AFP/ONP retirement, SIS eligibility changes) | MEDIUM | NO |
| Age heaping / soft manipulation in ENAHO age reporting | MEDIUM | PARTIALLY — McCrary is proposed but heaping at round numbers is not discussed |
| Payment modality heterogeneity (not all Pensión 65 recipients receive it digitally) | MEDIUM | NO — mechanism assumes digital delivery is universal |

HIGH unaddressed threats: **2**

### 7. Missing Elements

- Which ENAHO year(s)? Without this, data feasibility cannot be confirmed.
- First-stage documentation: What is the estimated jump in Pensión 65 receipt probability at age 65 in ENAHO or MIDIS data? A fuzzy RDD requires a strong first stage.
- Outcome variable definition: Exact ENAHO variable name and coding for digital wallet adoption.
- Exclusion restriction discussion: Does crossing age 65 affect digital adoption *only* through Pensión 65, or through other channels (retirement, reduced banking activity, other transfers)?
- Bandwidth sensitivity and donut-hole robustness around the cutoff.
- Placebo cutoffs at ages 60, 63, 67 to verify no spurious discontinuities.

## META-REVIEW

**Fairness**: The evaluation gives appropriate credit for the design's appeal — the running variable is clean, the policy context is real, and the tools proposed (McCrary, rdrobust, CCT) are standard practice. The identification score of 5/10 is not punitive; it reflects a Tier 2 strategy that is misclassified as Tier 1 in the proposal. Penalizing 5 points from a theoretical ceiling for a misspecification this fundamental is proportionate.

**Consistency**: Scores align with narrative throughout. The 8/10 on policy impact is supported by the explicit reasoning on MIDIS/MEF relevance and LAC transferability. The 5/10 on identification matches the detailed explanation of the sharp/fuzzy error and cohort confound. No mismatch detected.

**Completeness**: The evaluation catches all major threats. One addition worth flagging: **SUTVA / peer spillovers** — if Pensión 65 recipients in a village convince neighbors to adopt wallets, the control group (people just below 65 in the same village) may be contaminated. This is a medium-severity threat not listed. It does not change the verdict but should be surfaced for the researcher.

**Constructiveness**: The feedback is actionable. The researcher knows exactly what to fix: re-specify as fuzzy RDD with a first-stage table, identify which ENAHO year to use, add placebo cutoffs, and address the cohort confound (possibly by using multi-year ENAHO panels and focusing on the wave where digital wallets were introduced, or by arguing cohort smoothness explicitly). A researcher can open the evaluation and write a revision checklist directly from it.
