## EVALUATION

---

### 1. Research Question Clarity — 7/10

The question is well-posed at face value: a specific cutoff, a clear running variable, a measurable outcome. The causal claim is explicit. However, two issues blunt the score:

- **Conflation of eligibility and receipt**: Pensión 65 is not universally assigned at age 65. It is means-tested (SISFOH poverty classification), requires no overlapping pension (AFP/ONP), and has geographic targeting. "Crossing the age-65 threshold" is not the same as "receiving the transfer digitally." The question as written overstates what the RDD can identify.
- **Rural heterogeneity is raised in the mechanism but not formalized**. If this is a core claim, it needs to appear as a pre-specified subgroup analysis, not a sentence in the hypothesis block.

---

### 2. Identification Strategy — 5/10

**Source of Exogenous Variation**: The age-65 cutoff for Pensión 65 eligibility. Conceptually clean — age is not chosen strategically in continuous time, and the program's legal threshold creates a discontinuity in eligibility probability.

**Critical Misspecification — Sharp vs. Fuzzy**:
The proposal designates this as a *sharp* RDD. That is incorrect. Pensión 65 requires age ≥ 65 AND extreme poverty (SISFOH) AND no active pension. The probability of treatment jumps discontinuously at age 65 but does not reach 1. This is by definition a **fuzzy RDD**. Treating it as sharp conflates the Intent-to-Treat estimate with a LATE. The correct specification uses age as the instrument for program receipt, not as direct assignment. This is not a minor labeling error — it changes the estimand and the standard errors.

**Identification Tier**: Tier 2 (fuzzy RDD) if corrected. As currently specified (misclassified as sharp), the estimates would be attenuated and the design would be misrepresented to referees.

**Additional threats to the RDD continuity assumption**:

1. **Cross-sectional cohort confounds** (HIGH): In a cross-section, people aged 64 vs. 66 are different birth cohorts. Cohort-specific exposure to smartphones, digital literacy trends, or prior financial inclusion programs could create a spurious jump at age 65 unrelated to Pensión 65. RDD continuity requires that potential outcomes are smooth through the cutoff — with a cross-section, this assumption is far harder to defend than with panel data.

2. **Competing discontinuities at age 65** (MEDIUM): AFP/ONP formal retirement eligibility ages cluster near 65 in Peru. If other entitlements or behavioral changes (retirement itself, reduced labor income) also activate near 65, the estimated jump is not attributable solely to Pensión 65 receipt.

3. **Age heaping / soft manipulation** (MEDIUM): Rural Peru has documented age misreporting in administrative records. McCrary test is appropriate and proposed — but age heaping at round numbers (especially 60, 65, 70) can pass a standard McCrary test while still violating the no-manipulation assumption locally at the cutoff.

The McCrary test and CCT bandwidth selection are appropriate tools. The rdrobust call is standard. The visual inspection of year-by-year adoption rates is good practice. The bones of the design are sound — but the sharp/fuzzy misspecification and the cohort confound are not cosmetic problems.

---

### 3. Data Feasibility — 7/10

ENAHO is real, publicly available, and well-suited for this type of analysis. N=117K is large; density around age 65 will be more than adequate for CCT bandwidth selection.

Key gaps:

- **Year(s) unspecified**: "Time coverage: unknown" is a red flag. ENAHO financial modules change across waves. Digital wallet adoption (Yape, Plin) became measurable in Peru only around 2019–2021. Using a pre-2018 wave would find essentially zero adoption at any age, making the outcome trivially uninformative. The proposal must pin down which ENAHO edition(s) contain a usable digital wallet variable.
- **Outcome variable verification**: The proposal assumes ENAHO contains a digital wallet adoption variable. This needs confirmation — ENAHO covers general financial inclusion but the specific "billetera digital" item may require checking module availability by year.
- **First-stage validation**: Linking ENAHO to MIDIS district coverage is methodologically sensible for the fuzzy first stage, but this linkage is described as "supplementary" — it should be core to the design if the RDD is correctly specified as fuzzy.

---

### 4. Novelty & Contribution — 6/10

The forced-inclusion-via-transfers literature is active and has strong anchor papers (Bachas et al. 2021 QJE on Mexico; Muralidharan et al. 2016 AER on India Smartcard). The Peru-specific angle on Pensión 65, the RDD identification, and the focus on *digital wallets specifically* (rather than bank accounts or debit cards) represent a genuine incremental contribution. The elderly rural population is an underexplored margin. This is not transformative — it is one well-executed country study in a growing multi-country literature — but that is a reasonable target for a field paper.

---

### 5. Policy Relevance / Impact — 8/10

High. MIDIS and MEF are actively debating whether digitizing Pensión 65 payments drives lasting adoption or merely transactional compliance. This question has a direct operational counterpart. Results are transferable to similar programs across Latin America (Colombia's Colombia Mayor, Mexico's Sembrando Vida). The elderly rural margin is exactly where policymakers face the hardest inclusion challenge.

---

### 6. Threats to Validity

| Threat | Severity | Addressed? |
|---|---|---|
| Sharp RDD misspecification (program is means-tested; age 65 ≠ deterministic assignment) | HIGH | NO — proposal calls this sharp without justification |
| Cross-sectional cohort confounds (age 64 vs. 66 are different birth cohorts in cross-section) | HIGH | NO — not mentioned |
| Competing age discontinuities near 65 (AFP/ONP retirement, SIS eligibility changes) | MEDIUM | NO |
| Age heaping / soft manipulation in ENAHO age reporting | MEDIUM | PARTIALLY — McCrary is proposed but heaping at round numbers is not discussed |
| Payment modality heterogeneity (not all Pensión 65 recipients receive it digitally) | MEDIUM | NO — mechanism assumes digital delivery is universal |

HIGH unaddressed threats: **2**

---

### 7. Missing Elements

- Which ENAHO year(s)? Without this, data feasibility cannot be confirmed.
- First-stage documentation: What is the estimated jump in Pensión 65 receipt probability at age 65 in ENAHO or MIDIS data? A fuzzy RDD requires a strong first stage.
- Outcome variable definition: Exact ENAHO variable name and coding for digital wallet adoption.
- Exclusion restriction discussion: Does crossing age 65 affect digital adoption *only* through Pensión 65, or through other channels (retirement, reduced banking activity, other transfers)?
- Bandwidth sensitivity and donut-hole robustness around the cutoff.
- Placebo cutoffs at ages 60, 63, 67 to verify no spurious discontinuities.

## META-REVIEW

**Fairness**: The evaluation gives appropriate credit for the design's appeal — the running variable is clean, the policy context is real, and the tools proposed (McCrary, rdrobust, CCT) are standard practice. The identification score of 5/10 is not punitive; it reflects a Tier 2 strategy that is misclassified as Tier 1 in the proposal. Penalizing 5 points from a theoretical ceiling for a misspecification this fundamental is proportionate.

**Consistency**: Scores align with narrative throughout. The 8/10 on policy impact is supported by the explicit reasoning on MIDIS/MEF relevance and LAC transferability. The 5/10 on identification matches the detailed explanation of the sharp/fuzzy error and cohort confound. No mismatch detected.

**Completeness**: The evaluation catches all major threats. One addition worth flagging: **SUTVA / peer spillovers** — if Pensión 65 recipients in a village convince neighbors to adopt wallets, the control group (people just below 65 in the same village) may be contaminated. This is a medium-severity threat not listed. It does not change the verdict but should be surfaced for the researcher.

**Constructiveness**: The feedback is actionable. The researcher knows exactly what to fix: re-specify as fuzzy RDD with a first-stage table, identify which ENAHO year to use, add placebo cutoffs, and address the cohort confound (possibly by using multi-year ENAHO panels and focusing on the wave where digital wallets were introduced, or by arguing cohort smoothness explicitly). A researcher can open the evaluation and write a revision checklist directly from it.

## Step 5: lit_review
============================================================

## Literature Review: Digital Wallet Adoption via Government Transfer Digitization — Pensión 65 RDD

> **Note on sourcing**: The Semantic Scholar query returned zero verified results. Per the task instructions, I will not fabricate citations. The closest-papers section draws from my training knowledge and is clearly labeled as unverified — treat those references as leads to confirm, not citable sources. The methodological and gap analysis stands independently.

---

## 1. Closest Existing Papers

**No verified citations were returned by Semantic Scholar.** From training-time knowledge, the following are plausible close matches — *verify before citing*:

| Lead | Why relevant | Likely difference |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Bernal, Rigolini & Maguiña (various years) on Pensión 65 | Impact evaluations of the same program | Focus on consumption/health, not financial inclusion |
| Dupas & Robinson (2013, JPE) — savings accounts Kenya | Demand-side barriers to formal finance | Supply-side push via G2P, not voluntary take-up |
| Bachas, Gertler, Higgins & Seira (2021, AER) — Mexico OPORTUNIDADES debit cards | Closest structural analog: G2P digitization → formal finance | Mexican context, different program, different outcome (savings behavior) |
| Jack & Suri (2014, AER) — M-Pesa Kenya | Foundational: mobile money → welfare | Not G2P-driven; market-led diffusion mechanism |
| Muralidharan, Niehaus & Sukhtankar (2016, AER) — Andhra Pradesh smart cards | G2P → leakage reduction, not adoption per se | India, different outcome variable |

The **Bachas et al. (2021)** paper is almost certainly the anchor reference this paper would sit next to — it uses Bansefi/OPORTUNIDADES debit card rollout in Mexico to show G2P digitization generates savings behavior even among first-time account holders. The Peru/Pensión 65 version would contribute a different country, elderly population, and wallet-specific (not account-specific) outcome.

---

## 2. Methodological Precedents

### RDD on Pension Age Thresholds

Age-65 cutoffs have been used credibly in other contexts (US Social Security, Brazilian BPC, Chilean PBS). The identification logic is well-established: the running variable (age) is not manipulated because people cannot choose their birthdate. Standard concerns:

- **Density test**: McCrary (2008) is appropriate; bunching at 65 would suggest strategic misreporting, which in Peru's context with poor civil registration in rural areas is a genuine concern — *in reverse* (people slightly below 65 may claim to be older to access benefits)
- **Compound discontinuities**: Age 65 triggers other things simultaneously (formal retirement eligibility, health behavior changes, reduced labor force participation). Any jump in digital adoption at 65 may reflect retirement-induced technology adoption, not Pensión 65 specifically.

### G2P Digitization as Forced Inclusion

The Bachas et al. design (rollout variation across municipalities over time) is methodologically stronger than a single cross-section RDD because it can difference out age trends. Their first-stage is clean: account ownership jumps mechanically when the card is issued. The proposed design lacks this clean first-stage unless it can show that *receiving Pensión 65* (not just crossing age 65) discretely predicts wallet ownership.

---

## 3. Gap Analysis

### What gap does this fill?
The literature on G2P digitization mostly comes from Africa (M-Pesa context) and South Asia (Andhra Pradesh). Latin American evidence is sparse outside Mexico. Peru's Pensión 65 targets a particularly hard-to-reach population (rural elderly poor) where the "forced inclusion" hypothesis is most plausible — there are no physical payment alternatives, so digital or nothing.

### Is the gap genuine?

**Partly genuine, partly structural.** Three reasons the gap may exist for non-trivial reasons:

1. **Data problem**: ENAHO is cross-sectional. Observing a jump in digital wallet adoption at age 65 in a single cross-section conflates the *program effect* with *cohort effects*. People born in 1961 (age 65 today) adopted smartphones at a different life stage than people born in 1962 (age 64). This is not identified away by RDD — it is a violation of the continuity assumption that is inherently untestable in a single cross-section.

2. **Fuzzy, not sharp**: Pensión 65 is *means-tested and requires registration*. Not everyone who crosses age 65 receives it. The proposed design conflates Intent-to-Treat (turning 65) with Treatment (receiving digitized payments). A sharp RDD on age 65 estimates the reduced-form effect of *eligibility*, not of *digital payment receipt*. That's defensible but requires a clean first stage to be credible — does wallet ownership jump specifically among Pensión 65 recipients?

3. **Mechanism uncertainty**: Has Pensión 65 actually fully digitized payments? If a substantial fraction of beneficiaries still receive cash through agents or physical kiosks, the forcing mechanism collapses. This is a first-order empirical question the idea does not address.

### Could the gap be artificial?
Yes — the most likely reason this hasn't been done is the **cross-sectional identification problem**. A panel version of ENAHO, or a rollout design using MIDIS district-level digitization waves, would be far more credible. The single cross-section makes cohort effects an unresolvable confound.

---

## 4. Identification Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Source of variation** | Age-65 cutoff for Pensión 65 eligibility — clearly stated, plausible in principle |
| **Identification tier** | Nominally **Tier 1** (sharp RDD), but degrades to **Tier 2-3** in practice |
| **Main threat** | Cohort effects in a cross-section: people aged 64 vs. 65 belong to different birth cohorts with different lifetime digital exposure — RDD does NOT difference this out |
| **Second threat** | Compound discontinuities at 65 (retirement, health, labor supply) |
| **Third threat** | Non-random selection into Pensión 65 receipt conditional on crossing 65 (means-testing + registration barriers) → fuzzy design |
| **Pre-trends** | Cannot be tested — single cross-section provides one time point; no pre/post |
| **Manipulation** | Unlikely to be *downward* (no one delays aging), but upward misreporting of age (claiming 65+ to access benefits) is possible in rural Peru with weak civil registration |
| **Overall** | The RDD logic is sound in principle, but cross-sectional data makes the continuity assumption unverifiable. The cohort confound is the paper's single biggest vulnerability. |

**Bottom line on identification**: This would be a respectable Tier 1 design *with panel data or a rollout design*. With a single cross-section and age as the running variable, the cohort effect confound is severe enough that many referees will reject the continuity assumption outright. The paper needs either (a) panel data to compare the same individual before/after turning 65, or (b) a rollout design using MIDIS district-level digitization waves as the shock, or (c) a very careful argument for why cohort effects cannot explain the jump — which is difficult given the plausibility of digital adoption rising steadily across younger cohorts.

---

## 5. Positioning Statement

If this paper successfully addresses the cohort confound — either through a fuzzy RDD that conditions on Pensión 65 receipt or through auxiliary tests ruling out cohort effects — it would be cited in future G2P literature as: *"Among the few causal estimates of government transfer digitization on financial inclusion in Latin America, [Author] exploits Peru's Pensión 65 age eligibility cutoff to show that [result], consistent with/in contrast to the forced-inclusion findings of Bachas et al. (2021) in Mexico."* Without resolving the identification weakness, it would likely only appear in grey literature or descriptive reports, not a top-field journal.

### 1. VERIFICACIÓN DE CITAS

#### Cita 1: Bachas et al. 2021 QJE (México)
**ESTADO: REAL, PERO JOURNAL INCORRECTO**

El paper existe y es el correcto para este contexto: *"How Debit Cards Enable the Poor to Save More"* por Pierre Bachas, Paul Gertler, Sean Higgins y Enrique Seira. Los autores son correctos, el año es correcto, el país (México, programa Oportunidades/Prospera) es correcto, y el hallazgo (debit cards → mayor ahorro vía reducción de costos de transacción y monitoreo) es correcto.

**El error**: fue publicado en el **Journal of Finance** (2021), **NO en el QJE**. Esto no es un paper fabricado — es un error de atribución de revista. Para un referee, esto es una señal de que la revisión de literatura fue hecha de memoria o por terceros. El paper del mismo grupo sobre costos de transacción e inclusión financiera sí apareció en *AEA Papers & Proceedings* (2018), lo que puede ser la fuente de la confusión.

> **Corrección**: Bachas, P., Gertler, P., Higgins, S., & Seira, E. (2021). How Debit Cards Enable the Poor to Save More. *Journal of Finance*, 76(4), 1913–1957.

---

### 2. PAPERS CLAVE FALTANTES

La literatura review tiene solo dos citas explícitas. Eso es críticamente escaso. Los siguientes papers son ausencias graves:

| Paper | Por qué falta importa |
|---|---|
| **Lee & Lemieux (2010, JEL)** *"Regression Discontinuity Designs in Economics"* | La referencia canónica de RDD. Cualquier paper que use esta metodología DEBE citarla. Su ausencia en el borrador es una señal de alerta para editores. |
| **Calonico, Cattaneo & Titiunik (2014, Econometrica)** *rdrobust* | El evaluador menciona que el proposal usa CCT bandwidth selection y `rdrobust`, pero si no se cita el paper metodológico de respaldo, el método queda sin ancla bibliográfica. |
| **McCrary (2008, JoE)** *"Manipulation of the running variable in the regression discontinuity design"* | El evaluador menciona el McCrary test como herramienta propuesta. Si se usa, se cita. Sin esta cita, el robustness check queda técnicamente incompleto. |
| **Dupas & Robinson (2013, AEJ:Applied)** *"Savings Constraints and Microenterprise Development"* | Paper seminal en la literatura de inclusión financiera forzada. No citarlo es un hueco en el framing del contribution. |
| **Suri & Jack (2016, Science)** *"The Long-Run Poverty and Gender Impacts of Mobile Money"* | El paper más citado sobre efectos de largo plazo de servicios financieros digitales en pobres rurales. Ausente = revisión incompleta. |
| **IPA/Pensión 65 RDD existente** | Hay trabajo previo de IPA usando RDD en Pensión 65 (efectos en consumo, depresión, bienestar). Si el proposal no lo cita y se diferencia, un referee lo va a señalar inmediatamente como omisión estratégica o ignorancia. |
| **Bachas et al. (2018, AEA P&P)** *"Digital Financial Services Go a Long Way"* | El companion paper del mismo grupo sobre costos de transacción. Más directamente relevante que el de 2021 para el mecanismo propuesto. |

---

### 3. EVALUACIÓN DEL GAP RECLAMADO

**El gap es parcialmente genuino, pero requiere mayor defensa.**

Lo que existe: hay RDD previo sobre Pensión 65 centrado en bienestar, consumo y salud (trabajo de IPA, 2012–2015). Lo que no existe publicado: un estudio que use la discontinuidad de Pensión 65 específicamente para identificar adopción de *billeteras digitales* (Yape/Plin) en adultos mayores rurales.

El problema es que el gap puede ser un artefacto de timing: las billeteras digitales en Perú se masificaron post-2019. Cualquier wave de ENAHO anterior a ese año haría el outcome trivialmente cero. Esto no invalida la investigación — en realidad la acota — pero el paper debe hacer este argumento explícito: "usamos la wave X de ENAHO porque es la primera donde el outcome es no-trivial."

**Riesgo de working papers que llenen el gap**: MEDIO. No encontré un paper ya publicado que replique exactamente este diseño, pero el IDB tiene un programa activo de investigación en pagos digitales en LAC y Pensión 65 es suficientemente conocida para atraer atención. El riesgo de competencia existe.

---

### 4. EVALUACIÓN DE RIESGOS

**Riesgo de resultado nulo (null result)**:

La literatura base (Bachas et al., Muralidharan et al.) muestra efectos positivos de la inclusión financiera forzada vía transferencias, pero en esos contextos el mecanismo es "acceso a cuenta bancaria → ahorro". El mecanismo aquí es distinto: "transferencia digital → adopción de billetera (Yape/Plin)". Para adultos mayores rurales con baja alfabetización digital, el salto de "recibir en cuenta" a "usar activamente una billetera" es más grande y más incierto. El null result es plausible.

Adicionalmente: si Pensión 65 no paga vía billetera digital (muchos beneficiarios reciben en efectivo vía agente BIM o ventanilla), el mecanismo se rompe. Esto apuntala el riesgo de resultado nulo y el problema de SUTVA identificado por el meta-evaluador.

---

### VEREDICTO FINAL DEL FACT-CHECKER

El error de mayor impacto es el **journal incorrecto para Bachas et al.** (JF, no QJE). No invalida el argumento, pero daña la credibilidad ante un referee que conoce la literatura. Los **papers faltantes** son la segunda debilidad más seria — especialmente Lee & Lemieux (2010) y el trabajo previo de IPA/Pensión 65 en bienestar, cuya ausencia podría interpretarse como desconocimiento del campo.

## FINAL EDITORIAL VERDICT — Pensión 65 / Digital Wallet Adoption in Peru

---

### The Full Picture

After reading the complete evaluation chain — initial assessment, meta-review, literature review, and fact-checking — the picture is consistent across all four reviewers. This is not a case where the evidence diverges; the four steps converge on the same two core problems, and the question is whether those problems are fixable or fatal.

---

### Assessment by Dimension

**Research Question (solid)**
The question is real, tractable, and policy-relevant. MIDIS and MEF are actively debating this, and the elderly rural population is precisely the margin where the "forced inclusion" hypothesis is hardest to test and most consequential. The contribution would sit credibly in the Bachas–Muralidharan tradition of G2P digitization papers. This part of the proposal is strong.

**Identification (the core problem)**
Two issues, one fixable and one hard:

*Issue 1 — Sharp/fuzzy misspecification (fixable)*: The proposal specifies this as a sharp RDD. It cannot be. Pensión 65 requires age ≥ 65, extreme poverty (SISFOH), and no active pension. The probability of treatment jumps at 65 but does not reach 1. This must be respecified as a fuzzy RDD with age as the instrument for program receipt, plus a clean first-stage table. This is a correction, not a redesign.

*Issue 2 — Cross-sectional cohort confound (hard)*: People aged 64 and 66 in a single ENAHO cross-section belong to different birth cohorts with different lifetime digital exposure trajectories. The RDD continuity assumption requires that potential outcomes are smooth through the cutoff — but in a cross-section, cohort effects in technology adoption are precisely the kind of smooth-but-real trend that could generate a spurious jump at any age. The literature review flags this as potentially "unresolvable" with a single cross-section, and that judgment is correct. This is the proposal's single biggest vulnerability.

The cohort confound does NOT make this a dead end. Three credible paths exist:
- Stack multiple ENAHO waves and exploit the timing of Pensión 65 digital payment rollout across districts (rollout variation + age cutoff = differences-in-RD or shift-share design)
- Use district-level MIDIS data on when digital payments were introduced as a second source of variation
- Use the repeated ENAHO cross-sections before/after Yape/Plin mass adoption (2019 inflection) as a placebo: if the age-65 jump appears in 2016 (when no digital wallets existed), the cohort confound is the driver; if it appears only post-2020, the timing argues for program mechanism

None of these is trivial. All are tractable with 4–6 additional months of work.

**Mechanism Verification (prerequisite step)**
Neither the evaluators nor the fact-checker fully resolved the most basic empirical question: does Pensión 65 actually pay via digital wallet in the target ENAHO wave? If a substantial fraction of beneficiaries receive payments in cash through BIM agents or physical kiosks, the forcing mechanism collapses before the RDD is run. This verification must happen before any other design work.

**Data (contingent)**
ENAHO is real, accessible, and large enough. The problem is that the proposal does not specify which year. Digital wallets (Yape, Plin) only achieved measurable penetration in Peru post-2019. Using any pre-2018 wave would find essentially zero adoption at any age, making the outcome uninformative. The correct ENAHO wave is deterministic once the researcher confirms the outcome variable exists — but this confirmation is a required step, not an assumption.

**Literature Review Quality (weak but fixable)**
The citation base is too thin and contains one verifiable error (Bachas et al. is Journal of Finance, not QJE — the paper is real but the journal attribution is wrong). More critically, the proposal omits the canonical methodological references (Lee & Lemieux 2010, Calonico et al. 2014, McCrary 2008) that any referee will expect to see. This is correctable in one revision pass and does not affect the research design.

**Policy Relevance (genuine)**
The highest-scoring dimension throughout the evaluation chain. Results are directly applicable to MIDIS/MEF operations and transferable to analogous programs in Colombia, Mexico, and Bolivia. This is a genuine strength.

### Quality Ceiling

| Scenario | Realistic Target |
|---|---|
| Current design, minimal fixes (sharp→fuzzy, citations) | Economics Letters, Applied Economics |
| Cohort confound partially addressed with placebo tests | Latin American Economic Review, JLACEA |
| Rollout variation or stacked cross-section design | JDE, JHE, World Bank Economic Review |
| Full rollout design + strong first stage + mechanism evidence | Upper JDE — unlikely QJE/AER |

The ceiling without redesign is low. The ceiling with the rollout/stacked design is a solid field journal — which for this population and question is a meaningful contribution.

---

### Dealbreakers

Only one scenario constitutes a true dealbreaker: if Pensión 65 does not pay through digital wallets in the period covered by available ENAHO data, then the mechanism does not exist and the outcome is noise. This is empirically verifiable before significant investment, and the researcher should confirm this first.

The cohort confound is not a dealbreaker — it is a hard problem with known solutions. The sharp/fuzzy error is not a dealbreaker — it is a specification fix.

---

### Resource Assessment

| Item | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Verify mechanism (does P65 pay digitally, which ENAHO year) | 1–2 weeks |
| Respecify as fuzzy RDD + first stage | 2–4 weeks |
| Address cohort confound (preferred: stacked waves + rollout) | 2–4 months |
| Full draft with corrected literature | 2 months |
| **Total** | **5–7 months** |

Effort-to-impact ratio is **favorable if the mechanism holds**. If Pensión 65 digital payments exist in ENAHO and the rollout design is feasible, this is a 5-7 month paper targeting JDE. That is a good investment.

---

### Recommended Changes (ordered by priority)

1. **Verify the mechanism first (week 1, prerequisite)**: Confirm that Pensión 65 pays via digital wallet (Yape/Plin/BIM) in a post-2019 ENAHO wave. If the payment was cash-through-agent in that wave, stop and pivot.

2. **Respecify as fuzzy RDD (mandatory)**: Instrument for Pensión 65 receipt using age-65 eligibility. Document the first stage — show the jump in program receipt probability at the cutoff using ENAHO or MIDIS beneficiary data.

3. **Address the cohort confound (mandatory, choose a path)**: Either exploit rollout timing across districts, use stacked ENAHO waves around the 2019 digital adoption inflection, or run systematic placebo tests on pre-rollout waves. If none of these is feasible, the paper is limited to descriptive/suggestive findings and should be scoped accordingly.

4. **Add placebo cutoffs at 60, 62, 68, 70** to verify no spurious discontinuities from retirement or age-related behavioral changes.

5. **Fix the literature (one revision pass)**: Correct Bachas et al. journal attribution (JF, not QJE). Add Lee & Lemieux (2010), Calonico et al. (2014), McCrary (2008), and the IPA/Pensión 65 wellbeing papers. Differentiate from prior Pensión 65 evaluations explicitly.

## SECOND EDITOR REVIEW

**Score Calibration: Appropriate**

A score of 6.0 is correctly calibrated. The initial composite was 6.25, and the subsequent steps (lit review, fact-checking) did not improve the picture — they confirmed the concerns already identified. Awarding 7+ would require either dismissing the cohort confound (unjustified given the literature review's explicit warning) or treating the sharp/fuzzy error as cosmetic (it is not). Scoring below 5 would require the cohort confound to be completely unresolvable, which it is not — credible redesigns exist. 6.0 is the correct midpoint.

**Consistency with History: Full**

The verdict is consistent across all four steps. No reviewer found evidence that contradicted any other. The identification concerns are unanimous. The policy relevance score of 8/10 from the initial evaluation is reflected in the verdict's framing of the quality ceiling under a redesigned strategy. There are no inconsistencies to flag.

**Actionability: Sufficient**

The five recommended changes are ordered by priority and the first one is correctly identified as a binary gate: if the mechanism does not exist in the data, stop. The remaining four are specific enough to implement. A researcher can open this verdict and build a revision checklist directly.

**Missing Considerations**

One item the verdict does not address explicitly: **SUTVA/spillovers**. The meta-reviewer (Step A) raised this as a medium-severity threat: if Pensión 65 recipients in a village induce neighbors below 65 to adopt wallets (social learning), the control group is contaminated. In the rural Peruvian context where villages are small and word-of-mouth diffusion is plausible, this is worth one robustness check (excluding individuals in the same village as recipients). Not a dealbreaker, but should be in the recommended changes list.

IRB/privacy: no concern — ENAHO is a public anonymized survey.

Computation: no concern — this is a standard rdrobust workflow.

**Verdict Alignment: Confirmed**

```json
{
  "agree_with_verdict": true,
  "adjusted_score": 6.0,
  "adjustment_reason": "Score is correctly calibrated to the evidence. The cohort confound and sharp/fuzzy misspecification are both real and unresolved; the quality ceiling without redesign is genuinely low. The REVISE verdict is appropriate because fixable paths exist and the underlying question has real merit. One addition recommended: SUTVA/spillover robustness check (village-level contamination) should appear in the recommended changes list.",
  "final_recommendation": "REVISE"

**Final Score: 6.0 / 10 — REVISE**
