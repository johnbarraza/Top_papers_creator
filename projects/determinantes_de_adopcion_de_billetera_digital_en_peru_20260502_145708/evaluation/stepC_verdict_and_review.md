## FINAL EDITORIAL VERDICT — Pensión 65 / Digital Wallet Adoption in Peru

---

### The Full Picture

After reading the complete evaluation chain — initial assessment, meta-review, literature review, and fact-checking — the picture is consistent across all four reviewers. This is not a case where the evidence diverges; the four steps converge on the same two core problems, and the question is whether those problems are fixable or fatal.

---

### Assessment by Dimension

**Research Question (solid)**
The question is real, tractable, and policy-relevant. MIDIS and MEF are actively debating this, and the elderly rural population is precisely the margin where the "forced inclusion" hypothesis is hardest to test and most consequential. The contribution would sit credibly in the Bachas–Muralidharan tradition of G2P digitization papers. This part of the proposal is strong.

**Identification (the core problem)**
Two issues, one fixable and one hard:

*Issue 1 — Sharp/fuzzy misspecification (fixable)*: The proposal specifies this as a sharp RDD. It cannot be. Pensión 65 requires age ≥ 65, extreme poverty (SISFOH), and no active pension. The probability of treatment jumps at 65 but does not reach 1. This must be respecified as a fuzzy RDD with age as the instrument for program receipt, plus a clean first-stage table. This is a correction, not a redesign.

*Issue 2 — Cross-sectional cohort confound (hard)*: People aged 64 and 66 in a single ENAHO cross-section belong to different birth cohorts with different lifetime digital exposure trajectories. The RDD continuity assumption requires that potential outcomes are smooth through the cutoff — but in a cross-section, cohort effects in technology adoption are precisely the kind of smooth-but-real trend that could generate a spurious jump at any age. The literature review flags this as potentially "unresolvable" with a single cross-section, and that judgment is correct. This is the proposal's single biggest vulnerability.

The cohort confound does NOT make this a dead end. Three credible paths exist:
- Stack multiple ENAHO waves and exploit the timing of Pensión 65 digital payment rollout across districts (rollout variation + age cutoff = differences-in-RD or shift-share design)
- Use district-level MIDIS data on when digital payments were introduced as a second source of variation
- Use the repeated ENAHO cross-sections before/after Yape/Plin mass adoption (2019 inflection) as a placebo: if the age-65 jump appears in 2016 (when no digital wallets existed), the cohort confound is the driver; if it appears only post-2020, the timing argues for program mechanism

None of these is trivial. All are tractable with 4–6 additional months of work.

**Mechanism Verification (prerequisite step)**
Neither the evaluators nor the fact-checker fully resolved the most basic empirical question: does Pensión 65 actually pay via digital wallet in the target ENAHO wave? If a substantial fraction of beneficiaries receive payments in cash through BIM agents or physical kiosks, the forcing mechanism collapses before the RDD is run. This verification must happen before any other design work.

**Data (contingent)**
ENAHO is real, accessible, and large enough. The problem is that the proposal does not specify which year. Digital wallets (Yape, Plin) only achieved measurable penetration in Peru post-2019. Using any pre-2018 wave would find essentially zero adoption at any age, making the outcome uninformative. The correct ENAHO wave is deterministic once the researcher confirms the outcome variable exists — but this confirmation is a required step, not an assumption.

**Literature Review Quality (weak but fixable)**
The citation base is too thin and contains one verifiable error (Bachas et al. is Journal of Finance, not QJE — the paper is real but the journal attribution is wrong). More critically, the proposal omits the canonical methodological references (Lee & Lemieux 2010, Calonico et al. 2014, McCrary 2008) that any referee will expect to see. This is correctable in one revision pass and does not affect the research design.

**Policy Relevance (genuine)**
The highest-scoring dimension throughout the evaluation chain. Results are directly applicable to MIDIS/MEF operations and transferable to analogous programs in Colombia, Mexico, and Bolivia. This is a genuine strength.

### Quality Ceiling

| Scenario | Realistic Target |
|---|---|
| Current design, minimal fixes (sharp→fuzzy, citations) | Economics Letters, Applied Economics |
| Cohort confound partially addressed with placebo tests | Latin American Economic Review, JLACEA |
| Rollout variation or stacked cross-section design | JDE, JHE, World Bank Economic Review |
| Full rollout design + strong first stage + mechanism evidence | Upper JDE — unlikely QJE/AER |

The ceiling without redesign is low. The ceiling with the rollout/stacked design is a solid field journal — which for this population and question is a meaningful contribution.

---

### Dealbreakers

Only one scenario constitutes a true dealbreaker: if Pensión 65 does not pay through digital wallets in the period covered by available ENAHO data, then the mechanism does not exist and the outcome is noise. This is empirically verifiable before significant investment, and the researcher should confirm this first.

The cohort confound is not a dealbreaker — it is a hard problem with known solutions. The sharp/fuzzy error is not a dealbreaker — it is a specification fix.

---

### Resource Assessment

| Item | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Verify mechanism (does P65 pay digitally, which ENAHO year) | 1–2 weeks |
| Respecify as fuzzy RDD + first stage | 2–4 weeks |
| Address cohort confound (preferred: stacked waves + rollout) | 2–4 months |
| Full draft with corrected literature | 2 months |
| **Total** | **5–7 months** |

Effort-to-impact ratio is **favorable if the mechanism holds**. If Pensión 65 digital payments exist in ENAHO and the rollout design is feasible, this is a 5-7 month paper targeting JDE. That is a good investment.

---

### Recommended Changes (ordered by priority)

1. **Verify the mechanism first (week 1, prerequisite)**: Confirm that Pensión 65 pays via digital wallet (Yape/Plin/BIM) in a post-2019 ENAHO wave. If the payment was cash-through-agent in that wave, stop and pivot.

2. **Respecify as fuzzy RDD (mandatory)**: Instrument for Pensión 65 receipt using age-65 eligibility. Document the first stage — show the jump in program receipt probability at the cutoff using ENAHO or MIDIS beneficiary data.

3. **Address the cohort confound (mandatory, choose a path)**: Either exploit rollout timing across districts, use stacked ENAHO waves around the 2019 digital adoption inflection, or run systematic placebo tests on pre-rollout waves. If none of these is feasible, the paper is limited to descriptive/suggestive findings and should be scoped accordingly.

4. **Add placebo cutoffs at 60, 62, 68, 70** to verify no spurious discontinuities from retirement or age-related behavioral changes.

5. **Fix the literature (one revision pass)**: Correct Bachas et al. journal attribution (JF, not QJE). Add Lee & Lemieux (2010), Calonico et al. (2014), McCrary (2008), and the IPA/Pensión 65 wellbeing papers. Differentiate from prior Pensión 65 evaluations explicitly.

## SECOND EDITOR REVIEW

**Score Calibration: Appropriate**

A score of 6.0 is correctly calibrated. The initial composite was 6.25, and the subsequent steps (lit review, fact-checking) did not improve the picture — they confirmed the concerns already identified. Awarding 7+ would require either dismissing the cohort confound (unjustified given the literature review's explicit warning) or treating the sharp/fuzzy error as cosmetic (it is not). Scoring below 5 would require the cohort confound to be completely unresolvable, which it is not — credible redesigns exist. 6.0 is the correct midpoint.

**Consistency with History: Full**

The verdict is consistent across all four steps. No reviewer found evidence that contradicted any other. The identification concerns are unanimous. The policy relevance score of 8/10 from the initial evaluation is reflected in the verdict's framing of the quality ceiling under a redesigned strategy. There are no inconsistencies to flag.

**Actionability: Sufficient**

The five recommended changes are ordered by priority and the first one is correctly identified as a binary gate: if the mechanism does not exist in the data, stop. The remaining four are specific enough to implement. A researcher can open this verdict and build a revision checklist directly.

**Missing Considerations**

One item the verdict does not address explicitly: **SUTVA/spillovers**. The meta-reviewer (Step A) raised this as a medium-severity threat: if Pensión 65 recipients in a village induce neighbors below 65 to adopt wallets (social learning), the control group is contaminated. In the rural Peruvian context where villages are small and word-of-mouth diffusion is plausible, this is worth one robustness check (excluding individuals in the same village as recipients). Not a dealbreaker, but should be in the recommended changes list.

IRB/privacy: no concern — ENAHO is a public anonymized survey.

Computation: no concern — this is a standard rdrobust workflow.

**Verdict Alignment: Confirmed**

```json
{
  "agree_with_verdict": true,
  "adjusted_score": 6.0,
  "adjustment_reason": "Score is correctly calibrated to the evidence. The cohort confound and sharp/fuzzy misspecification are both real and unresolved; the quality ceiling without redesign is genuinely low. The REVISE verdict is appropriate because fixable paths exist and the underlying question has real merit. One addition recommended: SUTVA/spillover robustness check (village-level contamination) should appear in the recommended changes list.",
  "final_recommendation": "REVISE"

**Final Score: 6.0 / 10 — REVISE**
