**Key insight**: This is **purely associational** — without an instrument, policy discontinuity, or natural experiment, you cannot make causal claims. The best you can do is:

1. **Condition on observables** (matching, regression) — reveals associations under unconfoundedness
2. **Find instruments** — test if variables that affect adoption likelihood don't directly affect outcome (e.g., geographic network effects, policy rollout dates)
3. **Sensitivity analysis** — how large would an unmeasured confounder need to be to flip your conclusion?

The adoption gap by education, formality, and internet access is **real in the data**. Whether it's *causal* depends on whether you can rule out reverse causality and selection. Would you like me to walk through IV identification or matching strategy?
