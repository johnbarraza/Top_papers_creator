## Verified Matches

- **Running variable: age centered at 65** → `RUNNING_VAR = "EDAD"`, `THRESHOLD = 65`, `df_rdd["running_centered"] = df_rdd[RUNNING_VAR] - THRESHOLD` → **HIGH** → exact match
- **Primary outcomes: digital wallet adoption** → `OUTCOME_VARS = ["TIENE_BILLETERA", "USA_BILLETERA"]` in all four scripts → **HIGH** → consistent throughout
- **MSE-optimal bandwidth** → `bwselect="mserd"` in `run_rdd_rdrobust()` (`01_main.py:51`) → **HIGH** → correct selector
- **Triangular kernel** → `kernel="triangular"` in every rdrobust call → **HIGH** → matches CCT baseline recommendation
- **CCT bias-corrected robust CIs** → `rd.ci.iloc[-1]` extracted in `run_rdd_rdrobust()` (`01_main.py:63-67`); rdrobust returns conventional/robust/bc-robust rows → **MEDIUM** → extraction targets last row (bc-robust), but not verified against rdrobust's row ordering in this Python port
- **Clustering by state/region** → `CLUSTER_VAR = "DPTO"` passed as `cluster=` to rdrobust → **HIGH** → matches design
- **Manipulation/density test** → `rddensity(X=y_all, c=0)` in `02_robustness.py:66-82` → **HIGH** → correct package and cutoff
- **Covariate balance at bandwidth** → `df_bw = df[np.abs(df[RUNNING_VAR]) <= h_opt]` before balance test (`02_robustness.py:155`) → **HIGH** → correctly restricts to bandwidth first
- **Donut-hole robustness** → donut at 0.5 and 1.0 (`02_robustness.py:135-144`) → **HIGH** → implemented
- **All four output files produced** → Tables 1–4 + Figures 1–2 in `03_output.py` + density figure in `02_robustness.py` → **HIGH** → complete set

## Items To Verify

- **Fuzzy RDD / 2SLS (LATE)** → `TREATMENT_VAR = ""` in `00_clean.py:16`; no `ivregress`-equivalent anywhere; 01_main.py runs reduced-form only → **NOT FOUND** → code estimates ITT (age≥65 on outcome), never the LATE (P65_receipt_digital on outcome with instrument=age≥65)
- **First stage estimation** → no separate regression of P65_receipt on polynomial(age-65)×1(age≥65); no F-statistic reported → **NOT FOUND** → required before claiming fuzzy RDD is identified
- **P65_receipt / P65_receipt_digital variable** → not defined in any PROJECT-SPECIFIC VARIABLES block; no column mapped → **NOT FOUND** → the endogenous variable for the fuzzy design does not exist in the code
- **Mechanism verification cross-tab** → no cross-tab of P65 receipt by payment modality (digital vs cash) before regression → **NOT FOUND** → checklist flags this as a gate: if <50% digital among 65+, paper cannot proceed
- **Bandwidth sensitivity: 5-point table** → code tests only 3 multipliers (0.5×, 1×, 2×); checklist requires h/2, 2h/3, h, 4h/3, 2h → **LOW** → missing 2h/3 and 4h/3 points
- **CCT ci row ordering** → `rd.ci.iloc[-1]` assumes the last row of rdrobust's CI matrix is the bias-corrected robust CI; Python rdrobust may order rows differently than R → **MEDIUM** → needs unit test against a known dataset
- **INTERNET_HOGAR / SMARTPHONE dual role** → same variables appear in both `COVARIATES` and `PLACEBO_OUTCOMES`; using them as covariates in the main spec and then testing them as placebos conflates adjustment and validation → **MEDIUM** → either exclude from covariates list or use separate placebo variables
- **Kleibergen-Paap F-statistic** → not computed anywhere; required for weak instrument assessment in fuzzy RDD → **NOT FOUND**
- **Permutation p-value uses Silverman bandwidth** → `h_perm = 1.5 * np.std(x_perm)` (`02_robustness.py:196`) is not the MSE-optimal h; permutation and main estimation use different bandwidths → **MEDIUM** → inflate type-I error comparison
- **No heterogeneity table in 03_output.py** → `01_main.py` computes split-sample HTE results and appends to `all_results`, but `03_output.py` has no `make_table_heterogeneity()` function → **LOW** → HTE results are saved to CSV but never rendered to LaTeX
- **Polynomial sensitivity: p=1 and p=2 only** → `02_robustness.py` tests orders 1 and 2; a third-order check is sometimes expected for robustness → **MEDIUM** → minor gap
- **Digital wallet definition** → `TIENE_BILLETERA` / `USA_BILLETERA` are assumed correct but the mapping from raw ENAHO variables to these binary indicators is not shown in `00_clean.py` (they arrive pre-constructed) → **MEDIUM** → construction logic opaque

## Likely Discrepancies

- **Sharp vs. Fuzzy RDD — critical**: Paper's checklist requires a fuzzy RDD with `instrument = 1(age≥65)` and `endogenous = P65_receipt_digital`. Code sets `TREATMENT_VAR = ""` and constructs `treat = (running_centered >= 0)`, running a sharp RDD. This estimates ITT, not LATE. If take-up at the cutoff is below 1.0, ITT ≠ LATE and the structural claim fails.

- **No 2SLS anywhere**: The causal chain requires `P65 digital receipt → digital wallet adoption`. Without 2SLS, the code cannot distinguish whether the effect on wallets comes from program receipt or simply from being old enough to qualify.

- **First stage completely absent**: The checklist explicitly requires a first-stage table with jump magnitude, robust SE, and Kleibergen-Paap F ≥ 10. None of this is computed. A reviewer will immediately request it.

- **Mechanism verification gate skipped**: The cross-tab (share of 65+ receiving digital vs. cash payments) that determines whether the paper's causal chain holds is not in the code. If cash dominates, the entire instrument is invalid.

- **Bandwidth sensitivity table shape**: Paper strategy implies a 5-row table (h/2, 2h/3, h, 4h/3, 2h). Code produces 3 rows. Table 3 will not match the text if the paper describes all five multipliers.

- **INTERNET_HOGAR / SMARTPHONE as covariates AND placebos**: Using a variable as a covariate in the outcome equation and then as a placebo outcome in the same dataset is logically inconsistent — the placebo test is supposed to detect pre-existing discontinuities in predetermined variables, but conditioning on them removes that signal.

## Coverage Notes

- **Easy to match**: Running variable, threshold, kernel, bandwidth selector, cluster variable, and output file structure are all explicit in the PROJECT-SPECIFIC VARIABLES blocks and translate directly to the fixed code. No ambiguity.
- **Hardest gap**: The fuzzy RDD / 2SLS layer is entirely absent. This is not a configuration issue — it requires a new script or a substantial rewrite of `01_main.py` to add an IV estimation block using `linearmodels.iv` or a manual two-stage implementation.
- **Ambiguous**: Whether `rd.ci.iloc[-1]` correctly retrieves the bias-corrected robust CI depends on the Python rdrobust version's internal DataFrame structure. This should be verified empirically.
- **Silent data dependency**: `00_clean.py` assumes `TIENE_BILLETERA` and `USA_BILLETERA` already exist in `enaho_2024_clean.csv`. The construction of these binary indicators from raw ENAHO payment module variables is not visible in any script, so reproducibility is partial.
- **HTE results are computed but not rendered**: Split-sample heterogeneity estimates exist in the results CSV but have no corresponding LaTeX table, which means they cannot appear in the paper without additional output code.
- **Permutation test bandwidth mismatch**: The permutation inference uses a rule-of-thumb bandwidth while all other tests use MSE-optimal. This makes the permutation p-value not directly comparable to the main estimates.
