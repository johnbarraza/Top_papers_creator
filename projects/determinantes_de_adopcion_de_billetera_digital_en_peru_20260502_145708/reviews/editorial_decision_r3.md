## CODE ISSUES (require re-running scripts)

These issues require modifying Python scripts and re-executing them.
After fixing scripts, re-run ALL scripts to regenerate results,
then update main.tex with the new numbers.

## MAY-ADDRESS (polish)

1. [Style] Paper body is entirely absent from the provided file — review impossible
2. [Style] No \begin{document} tag present; preamble runs directly into bibliography
3. [Style] Cannot verify resolution of any Round 2 issues without body text

## REFEREE QUESTIONS (must answer in revised paper)

1. Table 1 sums to exactly 113,755 observations — the full sample. Was any bandwidth restriction applied before constructing this table? Please provide treated/control counts within the optimal bandwidth alongside the full-sample table.
2. ENAHO is a stratified probability sample requiring expansion weights for representative inference. Why are no survey weights applied? Please provide weighted estimates or restrict all population claims to the in-sample population.
3. Do any other Peruvian social programs change eligibility at the same threshold that identifies Pensión 65? How do you rule out compound discontinuities driving the estimated effect?
4. What is the Pensión 65 take-up rate among eligibles near the cutoff? Please provide the first-stage discontinuity so readers can scale the ITT estimate to a treatment-on-the-treated effect.
5. Table 1 shows treated individuals have lower wallet usage (3.19%) than controls (17.94%). Is this a pre-program age gradient in technology adoption? Please clarify the counterfactual logic and how the RDD recovers a causal estimate given this unconditional pattern.
6. NIVEL_EDUCATIVO has 2.1% missing in treated vs. 6.9% in control. Is this differential rate smooth through the cutoff? Does it affect covariate balance tests?
7. The submitted main.tex contains no paper body. Please confirm Round 2 textual corrections were implemented and resubmit the complete draft.
