## Production Editor Review: Tables & Figures

### TABLE 1 — `table_1_summary.tex`
*(Main.tex caption: "Summary Statistics by Age-65 Cutoff")*

**[CRITICAL] Nested float environment.** `table_1_summary.tex` wraps its content in a full `\begin{table}...\end{table}` environment. Main.tex `\input{}`s it inside *another* `\begin{table}`. LaTeX does not allow nested floats — this will either throw a compilation error or produce a double caption. The file should contain only the `tabular` and `threeparttable` contents, with no outer `\begin{table}` wrapper.

**[CRITICAL] Duplicate label `tab:summary`.** The label is defined both in main.tex's outer `\begin{table}` block and again inside the imported file. LaTeX will emit a multiply-defined label warning and references may resolve incorrectly.

**[MAJOR] Four "---" phantom columns.** Each side of the table has a fourth column whose header and every cell contain nothing but "---". The note says this indicates "unavailable data," but there is no data intended for that column — the columns serve no purpose and waste space. Delete them; a three-column layout (Mean, SD, N) per group is standard.

**[MAJOR] INGRESO\_PC has no unit in the table.** The mean is 13,454 — is this Peruvian soles (S/)? The variable name alone does not tell the reader. Add "(S/)" to the row label or a column-header note.

**[MAJOR] Missing-observation discrepancy unexplained.** NIVEL\_EDUCATIVO reports N = 13,793 (treated) and 92,826 (control) versus the group totals of 14,088 and 99,667. The ~3.5% attrition is not explained in the notes. Add: "NIVEL\_EDUCATIVO has X missing values; remaining statistics exclude them."

**[MINOR] Variable names are raw code strings.** TIENE\_BILLETERA, USA\_BILLETERA, INTERNET\_HOGAR, etc. should be replaced with descriptive English or Spanish labels (e.g., "Digital Wallet Ownership," "Active Wallet Use," "Household Internet Access"). Code names belong in the data appendix, not the publication table.

**[MINOR] Caption mismatch.** Main.tex caption says "Summary Statistics by Age-65 Cutoff"; the file's own caption says "Summary Statistics by Treatment Status." Once the nested-table issue is fixed (one caption remains), decide on a single consistent caption.

**[MINOR] `\begin{tablenotes}` without `threeparttable` wrapper.** The notes are inside `\begin{tablenotes}` but the `tabular` is not wrapped in `\begin{threeparttable}...\end{threeparttable}`. The notes will not render in the correct position. Although `threeparttable` is loaded in main.tex, the wrapper must surround the specific table body.

---

### TABLE 2 — `table_2_main_results.tex`
*(Main.tex caption: "Main RDD Results: Effect of Crossing Age 65 on Digital Wallet Outcomes")*

**[CRITICAL] Nested float environment.** Same structural defect as Table 1 — the file contains its own `\begin{table}` wrapper. Will not compile cleanly when `\input{}`'d into main.tex.

**[CRITICAL] Label mismatch breaks cross-reference.** Main.tex defines `\label{tab:main}` and the text references `Table~\ref{tab:main}`. The file defines `\label{tab:main_results}`. These are different keys; `\ref{tab:main}` will resolve to "??" in the PDF.

**[CRITICAL] het\_POBREZA\_low repeats the full-sample baseline estimates verbatim.** The block for `het_POBREZA_low` shows Estimate = −0.0056, SE = 0.0165, CI = [−0.0336, 0.0310], N/BW = 27,809 / 14.24 — identical to the baseline. The same duplication appears for `het_SMARTPHONE_low`. These look like copy-paste errors; the subsample RDD should produce different point estimates, bandwidths, and N. Verify and correct.

**[MAJOR] Column headers use raw variable names.** "TIENE\_BILLETERA" and "USA\_BILLETERA" are not self-explanatory to a reader unfamiliar with ENAHO codebooks. Replace with "Digital Wallet Ownership" and "Active Wallet Use" (with the variable name relegated to a note or parenthetical).

**[MAJOR] Method names are implementation artefacts.** "rdrobust" and "statsmodels\_WLS" in the "Method" row expose the software stack, not the econometric method. Replace with "Local-linear RD" and "WLS (linear, triangular kernel)" or similar journal-ready descriptions.

**[MAJOR] Permutation p-value (p = 0.434) appears only in prose, never in a table.** The primary inference result for the main outcome should be reported in a table row (e.g., "Randomization p-value" panel). Readers should not have to hunt prose for the headline test statistic.

**[MAJOR] Heterogeneity subgroup labels are opaque.** "het\_POBREZA\_low", "het\_INTERNET\_HOGAR\_low", "het\_SMARTPHONE\_high" are not human-readable panel headers. Use "By poverty status: poor/extreme-poor", "By internet access: no access", etc.

**[MINOR] "N / BW" row conflates two distinct statistics.** Use separate rows or columns: "Observations" and "Optimal Bandwidth (years)."

---

### TABLE 3 — `table_3_robustness.tex`
*(Main.tex caption: "Robustness Checks")*

**[CRITICAL] Nested float environment.** Same defect — file contains its own `\begin{table}` wrapper.

**[CRITICAL] Panel B (donut-hole) shows identical estimates for 0.5 and 1.0 year exclusions.** Both rows show Estimate = −0.0014, SE = 0.0213, CI = [−0.0388, 0.0449], BW = 10.65, N = 19,434. Excluding a different donut window must change the effective sample and the optimal bandwidth; these cannot legitimately be equal. This is almost certainly a data error — the 1.0-year donut result was not computed and the 0.5-year result was pasted twice.

**[MAJOR] Dependent variable not stated anywhere in the table.** The table contains six different tests but never states which outcome variable is being estimated. The header or a table note must specify: "Outcome: TIENE\_BILLETERA (digital wallet ownership)."

**[MAJOR] Two "TIENE\_BILLETERA" rows in Panel D are indistinguishable.** The table lists:

```
TIENE_BILLETERA | -0.0067 | 0.0006 | [-0.0083, -0.0062] | 7.41 | 99,667
TIENE_BILLETERA | 0.0080  | 0.0148 | [-0.0176, 0.0403]  | 7.21 | 99,667
```

The text identifies these as placebo cutoffs at age 15 and age 53, but the table provides no such label. The first row also has N = 99,667 (the full below-threshold sample) which is atypical for a placebo cutoff. These rows need distinct, descriptive labels ("Placebo: age 15", "Placebo: age 53") and the sample scope must be explained.

**[MAJOR] McCrary density test statistic absent from table.** The text reports a test statistic of 2.0 for the running-variable manipulation test (\citealt{cattaneo2018}) but this result does not appear in Table 3 or any table. Add a "Panel E: Density test" row with the test statistic and p-value.

**[MINOR] Panel D mixes two conceptually different placebo types** (covariate placebos in the first two rows, cutoff placebos in the last two) without separating them. Split into Panel D (covariate placebos) and Panel E (placebo cutoffs).

---

### TABLE 4 — `table_4_covariate_balance.tex`
*(Main.tex caption: "Covariate Balance at Age-65 Cutoff (RDD Estimates)")*

**[CRITICAL] Nested float environment.** Same defect as the other three tables.

**[CRITICAL] Label mismatch breaks cross-reference.** Main.tex defines `\label{tab:balance}`; the text references `Table~\ref{tab:balance}`. The file defines `\label{tab:cov_balance}`. The reference will produce "??" in the PDF.

**[MINOR] Asterisk footnote defined but never used.** The note says "$^{*}$ 95% CI excludes zero" but no row in the table carries a superscript asterisk. Either remove the footnote definition or apply the asterisk to rows where the CI excludes zero (none in this table, which is the expected/reassuring result — but the dangling footnote is confusing).

**[MINOR] NIVEL\_EDUCATIVO N discrepancy.** N = 27,325 versus 27,809 for all other covariates. The ~1.7% difference is not explained in the notes.

**[MINOR] Caption mismatch between main.tex and file.** "Covariate Balance at Age-65 Cutoff (RDD Estimates)" vs "Covariate Balance at the Age-65 Eligibility Threshold (Within Bandwidth)." Fix to a single caption after resolving the nested-float issue.

---

### FIGURE 1 — RDD Plot (`figure_1_rdplot`)

**[MAJOR] Internal inconsistency in prose description.** Section 4.5 states: "rates rise from approximately 4% at age 50 to a maximum of 11% *near age 35 (younger adults)*." Age 35 is far outside the bandwidth (h* = 14.2 years around 65) and inconsistent with "the binned scatter shows a smooth age profile." This is either a typo (should be "age 55" or "age 40") or a misdescription of the figure. Verify against the actual plot and correct.

**[MAJOR] Caption is not self-contained on sample scope.** It does not state whether the plot shows the full sample or only observations within the optimal bandwidth. Add: "Observations within [age range]. Bandwidth h* = 14.2 years."

**[MINOR] No axis label units specified.** The caption should state x-axis = "Age (years)" and y-axis = "Share with digital wallet (proportion)." These may be on the figure itself, but the caption should be self-sufficient for a reader who sees only the caption in a proof.

**[MINOR] No data source or bin-width noted.** Add: "Source: ENAHO 2024. Each bin represents [X] age-year observations."

---

### FIGURE 2 — Bandwidth Sensitivity (`figure_2_bandwidth_sensitivity`)

**[MINOR] Column header uses code variable name.** Caption says "primary outcome (\texttt{TIENE\_BILLETERA})" — acceptable in a caption, but should be followed by the plain-language label: "digital wallet ownership."

**[MINOR] Caption does not specify axis units.** x-axis = "Bandwidth (years)"; y-axis = "RD point estimate (proportion)."

**[MINOR] Caption does not specify number of bandwidths shown.** "across bandwidth choices ranging from h*/2 to 2h*" — add the actual range in years: "from 7.1 to 28.5 years."

---

### FIGURE 3 — McCrary Density Plot (`figure_mccrary_density`)

**[MAJOR] Test statistic and p-value absent from caption.** The McCrary/Cattaneo density test produces a test statistic and p-value that should appear here (or in a table). The text says "test statistic of 2.0" but gives no p-value and the figure caption is silent on both. Add: "Cattaneo–Jansson–Ma density test statistic = 2.0 (p = [value]). Null: no manipulation at the cutoff."

**[MINOR] Histogram range not specified.** "Around the Age-65 Cutoff" is vague. State the age range displayed.

**[MINOR] No y-axis unit described.** Specify whether the y-axis is raw counts, relative frequency, or kernel-density estimate.

---

### BIBLIOGRAPHY

**[MAJOR] Orphan bibliography entry.** `\bibitem[Deming and Noray(2023)]{deming2023}` (Deming & Noray, *QJE*, 2023) is defined but never cited anywhere in the text. Remove it or add the citation.

**[MINOR] Malformed natbib author-year key.** `\bibitem[Ardington et~al.2016]{ardington2016}` is missing the parentheses around the year required for the natbib author-year style: should be `[Ardington et~al.(2016)]`. This will produce malformed in-text citations.
