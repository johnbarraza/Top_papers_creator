## 1. Spelling, Grammar & Style

## Copy-Edit Report — Round 4

**Scope**: Language, style, typography, and number formatting only. Prior round numerical/table issues (Round 3 CRITICAL-1: Table 3 vs Table 4 covariate discrepancy) are not re-raised here but remain unaddressed in the body text.

---

### Round 2 Carry-Forward

**[MAJOR-CARRY] "centred" / "centered" inconsistency — unresolved from Round 2.**
Both spellings appear in the same document. American "centered" is used in §5 ("The estimate is centered very close to zero"), while British "centred" appears in §1 ("centred on zero"), §5 ("centred near zero"), and §5 heterogeneity ("centred near zero"). Choose one orthography throughout and apply it consistently. Given that other American spellings are used (e.g., "behavior," "labor"), the correct choice is **"centered"**.

---

### Abstract

**[MAJOR-1] Ambiguous phrase: "other age-65-specific changes on the running variable."**
The sentence reads: *"the combined effect of crossing the institutional threshold associated with Pensi\'on 65 and other age-65-specific changes on the running variable."* The phrase "changes on the running variable" is opaque — a reader cannot tell whether this modifies "threshold" or "changes." Intended meaning is likely: *"…and any other institutional changes that occur at the age-65 threshold."* Revise accordingly.

**[MINOR-1] "Governments worldwide are betting…" — informal register.**
"Betting" is colloquial in an abstract submitted to a top-field journal. Replace with "positing," "hypothesizing," or "premised on the assumption."

---

### Section 1 (Introduction)

**[MAJOR-2] Terminological contradiction: "sharp regression discontinuity."**
The sentence reads: *"We exploit this design with a sharp regression discontinuity (RDD) using the 2024 round of ENAHO."* The paper has just explained, in the preceding paragraph, that the design is *fuzzy* with respect to program receipt. Calling it a "sharp RDD" contradicts the stated characterization. Drop "sharp": *"We exploit this design with a regression discontinuity (RDD)…"*

**[MAJOR-3] Missing words: "an ITT estimate of institutional access on digital adoption."**
The phrase is grammatically incomplete. Should read: *"an ITT estimate of the effect of institutional access on digital adoption."*

**[MINOR-2] Flag word: "Critically, the disbursement mechanism is digital."**
"Critically" functions here as a rhetorical intensifier, not an analytical judgment. Delete it and restructure: *"The disbursement mechanism is digital:…"*

**[MINOR-3] Awkward preposition: "outside cash."**
*"roughly one in five adult transactions outside cash"* — "outside cash" is non-standard. Use "non-cash" or "beyond cash."

**[MINOR-4] Word choice: "Existing literature is insufficient on two fronts."**
"Insufficient" does not accurately describe an existing body of work; it describes a gap within it. Use "thin," "limited," or "incomplete" instead.

---

### Section 2 (Literature Review)

**[MINOR-5] Hyphenation error: "sharply-identified evidence."**
Adverbs ending in *-ly* do not take hyphens before adjectives. Write **"sharply identified evidence"**.

---

### Section 4 (Empirical Strategy)

**[MAJOR-4] Circular self-reference.**
Within §4 (labeled `\label{sec:strategy}`), the estimation-equations subsection states: *"As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:strategy}, $\tau$ is interpreted as a local ITT effect…"* This is a forward reference to the section the reader is already in. Change to *"As discussed above,"* or refer to the specific subsection/assumption that was laid out earlier (Equation~\ref{eq:itt} or the three assumptions enumerated in §4.1).

---

### Section 5 (Results)

**[MINOR-6] Flag word: "Importantly, this covariate-adjusted specification uses a wider bandwidth."**
Delete "Importantly." The sentence is already clear without the intensifier: *"This covariate-adjusted specification uses a wider bandwidth…"*

**[MINOR-7] Ambiguous single value for two donut-hole specifications.**
*"yield estimates of $-0.001$"* — both the $\pm 0.5$ and $\pm 1.0$ donut-hole specs apparently yield the same value. If they differ, report both. If they genuinely agree, write *"both yield $-0.001$"* to make the equality explicit rather than leaving readers to infer it.

**[MINOR-8] Confusing "largest/smallest" for signed estimates.**
*"the largest subgroup point estimate is $-0.021$…and the smallest is $+0.004$"* — in the context of a policy effect where positive is the predicted direction, calling $-0.021$ the "largest" is counterintuitive. Revise to: *"the most negative estimate is $-0.021$…and the most positive is $+0.004$."*

**[MINOR-9] "centred near zero"** — see MAJOR carry-forward above. Standardize to "centered."

**[MINOR-10] Redundant statement about no discontinuity.**
In §5.4 (visual evidence): *"…with no visible jump at the threshold. There is no visible discontinuity at age 65."* The second sentence repeats the first verbatim. Delete one.

---

### Section 6 (Discussion)

**[MAJOR-5] Limitations section structure contradicts stated count.**
The paper states *"Five limitations bear emphasis"* but delivers them inconsistently: the first two carry bold headers (**Integer running variable**, **Dual eligibility**) while the remaining three are labeled **First / Second / Third** without headers — and are structurally run together under the **Dual eligibility** paragraph, making it unclear whether "First" continues the dual-eligibility discussion or opens a new limitation. Apply bold headers to all five, or renumber them uniformly as a numbered list.

**[MINOR-11] Awkward construction: "dilutes…by the factor of non-take-up."**
*"The intent-to-treat estimate dilutes whatever effect exists among actual recipients by the factor of non-take-up."* More natural: *"…is attenuated by the rate of non-take-up."*

**[MINOR-12] Informal: "passive cashout point."**
"Cashout" is informal. Replace with *"cash-withdrawal point"* or *"a passive mechanism for withdrawing cash."*

**[MINOR-13] "works best when paired" — "best" is unjustified.**
The paper documents a null under the standalone institutional channel; it does not document a paired condition for comparison. *"Best"* implies a tested ranking. Use *"is more likely to be effective when paired"* or *"works better when paired."*

**[MINOR-14] Informal: "Policymakers betting on transfer digitization."**
Same register issue as the abstract. Replace with *"Policymakers relying on"* or *"Policymakers counting on."*

**[MINOR-15] Preposition: "policy attention on the elderly poor."**
*"Policy attention on the elderly poor population should focus on…"* — "attention on" is non-standard. Write *"Policy attention directed at the elderly poor"* or *"Policymakers targeting the elderly poor."*

---

### Section 7 (Conclusion)

**[MINOR-16] "bound it above" → "bound it from above."**
*"our intent-to-treat estimates in the ENAHO sample bound it above by approximately three percentage points"* — the standard idiom is **"bound it from above."**

---

### Sample Arithmetic (§3.1–3.2)

- 117,721 − 3,966 = 113,755 ✓ ; 3,966/117,721 = 3.37% ≈ 3.4% ✓
- 99,667 + 14,088 = 113,755 ✓ ; matches Table 1 ✓
- Bandwidth split: 17,047 + 10,762 = 27,809 ✓ ; BW = 14.24 ✓

**[MAJOR-1] Population means in §3.2 don't reconcile with Table 1 group means.**

Text states:
- `TIENE_BILLETERA` population mean = **7.4%**
- `USA_BILLETERA` population mean = **15.6%**

Back-calculation from Table 1 (unweighted, no weights column per audit):

```
TIENE_BILLETERA: (99,667×0.0800 + 14,088×0.0535) / 113,755
               = (7,973 + 754) / 113,755 = 8,727 / 113,755 = 7.67%

USA_BILLETERA:  (99,667×0.1794 + 14,088×0.0319) / 113,755
               = (17,882 + 449) / 113,755 = 18,331 / 113,755 = 16.1%
```

Discrepancies: **0.27 pp** for ownership and **0.5 pp** for active use. The most likely cause is that some respondents have missing values on the outcome variables, reducing the effective denominator below 113,755 — but this is never disclosed in the paper. Undisclosed item non-response on the primary outcomes is a data-quality issue that should be reported in the sample-construction section.

---

### Covariate Balance: §4.3 vs. Table 4

| Claim | Text | Table 4 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| SMARTPHONE jump | +0.014, CI [−0.015, 0.086] | 0.0139, [−0.0146, 0.0857] | ✓ |
| INTERNET\_HOGAR jump | +0.015, CI [−0.061, 0.131] | 0.0147, [−0.0607, 0.1308] | ✓ |
| INGRESO\_PC jump | −S/47, CI [−2,079, 3,172] | −47.12, [−2078.60, 3171.92] | ✓ |

**[MINOR-1] Baseline income figure unverified.** Section 4.3 describes the income jump as "−S/47 on a baseline mean of S/11,700." Table 1 shows the below-cutoff full-sample mean for `INGRESO_PC` is S/11,416.51 — a discrepancy of S/283 (~2.5%). The paper may be citing a bandwidth-restricted control mean (ages 50–64) rather than the full below-cutoff mean, which is plausible but not stated. The source of S/11,700 is unspecified.

---

### [CRITICAL-1] Table 3 Panel D vs. Table 4 — Unresolved from Round 3

This issue was flagged as CRITICAL in Round 3. It remains unresolved. Both `INTERNET_HOGAR` and `SMARTPHONE` appear as RDD outcomes in Table 3 Panel D ("Placebo — covariates as outcomes") and Table 4 ("Covariate Balance") with **irreconcilable numbers**:

| Variable | Table | Estimate | SE | CI | BW | N |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| INTERNET\_HOGAR | Table 3 Panel D | 0.0139 | 0.0487 | [−0.0615, 0.1296] | **15.23** | **29,668** |
| INTERNET\_HOGAR | Table 4 | 0.0147 | 0.0489 | [−0.0607, 0.1308] | **14.24** | **27,809** |
| SMARTPHONE | Table 3 Panel D | 0.0138 | 0.0246 | [**−0.0218, 0.0748**] | 14.29 | 27,809 |
| SMARTPHONE | Table 4 | 0.0139 | 0.0256 | [**−0.0146, 0.0857**] | 14.24 | 27,809 |

For `INTERNET_HOGAR`: BW diverges by 0.99 years; N diverges by **1,859 observations**; estimates are not identical. For `SMARTPHONE`: the CI upper bounds differ by **0.011** (0.0748 vs. 0.0857 — a 14% gap in interval width), despite identical N. Neither table contains a note explaining the discrepancy.

The body text (§4.3) cites the Table 4 values when describing the balance test, making Table 3 Panel D internally redundant and inconsistent. **A referee comparing these two tables will flag the paper as containing an unreported specification switch.**

---

### [MAJOR-2] Table 3 Panel A — H Double CI Anomaly

The bias-corrected CI for `H Double` shows an unusually large shift from the conventional estimate:

| Spec | Estimate | CI | CI midpoint | Shift |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H Half | −0.0056 | [−0.0499, 0.0370] | −0.0065 | −0.0009 |
| H Optimal | −0.0056 | [−0.0397, 0.0306] | −0.0046 | +0.0010 |
| **H Double** | **−0.0204** | **[−0.0272, 0.0264]** | **−0.0004** | **+0.0200** |

For `H Half` and `H Optimal`, the rdrobust bias-correction shifts the CI midpoint by less than 0.001 from the conventional estimate — negligible. For `H Double`, the shift is **+0.020**: the bias-corrected CI is centered near 0, not near −0.0204. This implies the estimated bias at `h = 28.48` is approximately equal to the conventional point estimate itself — the bias-correction absorbs essentially the entire signal.

This is a substantively important finding. At twice the optimal bandwidth the bias grows large enough that the conventional estimate (−2.0 pp) and the bias-corrected estimate (~0 pp) are telling very different stories. The text currently says only "all 95% confidence intervals overlapping zero" without acknowledging that the H Double estimate is anomalous in this respect. This deserves explicit discussion: either the wider bandwidth is too far from the cutoff for the local linear to be unbiased, or the estimate at that bandwidth is unreliable. The paper's own bandwidth-selection procedure chose `h* = 14.24` precisely to balance bias and variance; the H Double result illustrates why that choice matters.

---

### Robustness Checks: §4.2 vs. Table 3

**[MINOR-2] Donut-hole rounding.** Text: "yield estimates of −0.001, removing the small negative point estimate entirely." Table 3: ±0.5 yr estimate = −0.0001. That rounds to −0.000, not −0.001. A ten-fold difference in the last digit may seem trivial but is inconsistent with the paper's standard of 3-decimal precision.

**[MINOR-3] Bandwidth rounding.** Text states h*/2 = 7.1 (Table 3: 7.12) and 2h* = 28.5 (Table 3: 28.48). Minor, but inconsistent with the paper's own 2-decimal precision for bandwidths.

---

### USA\_BILLETERA Bandwidth Not Disclosed

**[MINOR-4]** Table 2 shows that `USA_BILLETERA` baseline uses **BW = 17.29, N = 33,267** — materially different from `TIENE_BILLETERA`'s BW = 14.24, N = 27,809. The paper consistently refers to "the optimal bandwidth h* = 14.24" as a single figure (Abstract, §3.2, §4.1, §5.1) without ever noting that the second outcome has a distinct optimal bandwidth. A reader comparing bandwidth sensitivity or replication output will find the numbers for active use do not reproduce under h* = 14.24.

---

### Remaining Checks: All Pass

- Sample split arithmetic, heterogeneity subgroup numbers (Table 2 vs. §4.4–4.5), and covariate balance CIs in §4.3 all match the tables after rounding.
- The `deming2023` phantom citation (CRITICAL-2 in Round 3) does not appear in the current manuscript — **resolved**.
- The WLS bandwidth-switch disclosure (MAJOR-1 in Round 3) is addressed in §4.1 with an explicit warning about the wider bandwidth and secular age gradient interpretation — **adequately disclosed**.
- Permutation p = 0.434 and Cohen's d = −0.021 are internally consistent with the estimate magnitudes, though not directly verifiable from the tables.

---

## Summary

The three outstanding numerical integrity problems are the Table 3/Table 4 duplication with incompatible values (unresolved from Round 3), the H Double bias-correction anomaly (suggesting the 2h* robustness check is essentially uninformative and should be discussed as such), and the undisclosed item non-response on the primary outcomes. The remaining issues are minor presentational matters.

## 3. Unsupported Claims & Identification Integrity

## Claim Discipline Audit — Regression Discontinuity Report on Pensión 65 and Digital Wallet Adoption

---

### [CRITICAL-1] "Consistent with zero across every specification" directly contradicts Table 2

**Exact sentence (Discussion §6.1):**
> "The intent-to-treat estimates are small, precisely bounded, and consistent with zero across every specification, bandwidth, and inference procedure we examined."

**What the evidence shows:** Table 2 reports two WLS covariate-adjusted specifications whose 95% confidence intervals for `TIENE_BILLETERA` *exclude* zero:

| Specification | Estimate | CI |
|---|---|---|
| with\_covariates (WLS) | −0.0270 | [−0.0373, **−0.0167**] |
| extended\_covariates (WLS) | −0.0257 | [−0.0363, **−0.0152**] |

Both lower and upper bounds are negative. "Every specification" is therefore factually false — two of the five reported specifications yield a statistically significant negative result on the primary outcome. The paper attempts a post-hoc rescue by invoking the randomization p-value (0.434), but that permutation test was run on the primary rdrobust baseline, not on the WLS specifications. There is no evidence the permutation null was re-run under the WLS data-generating process. The paper cannot simultaneously report Table 2 and claim all estimates are "consistent with zero."

**Required fix:** Rewrite to acknowledge that the covariate-adjusted WLS estimates reject the null under asymptotic inference, and explain precisely why those estimates are discounted in favor of the rdrobust baseline and permutation test — citing the integer running variable and the bandwidth difference, not a blanket "all specifications are null."

---

### [CRITICAL-2] Table 3 vs. Table 4 numerical inconsistency for `INTERNET_HOGAR` — unresolved from Round 3

The same variable (`INTERNET_HOGAR`) appears in both:
- **Table 3, Panel D (Placebo):** BW = 15.23, N = 29,668
- **Table 4 (Covariate Balance):** BW = 14.24, N = 27,809

The sample sizes differ by **1,859 observations**. Neither table contains a footnote explaining why the same outcome is estimated under two different bandwidths. A referee comparing the tables — as Round 3 already flagged — will halt. This is unresolved carry-forward.

---

### [MAJOR-1] Causal language applied to an ITT estimate that cannot isolate the program mechanism

**Exact sentence (Discussion §6.3):**
> "institutional digitization of government transfers should be evaluated against a realistic counterfactual: in the absence of complementary digital-literacy and smartphone-access programs, crossing the eligibility threshold does not, on average, **induce** active wallet adoption."

"Induce" is a causal verb. The paper's design is an ITT RDD at the age-65 threshold — it identifies the combined effect of crossing that threshold across the entire age-65 population, not the effect of Pensión 65 specifically. The ITT absorbs any other discontinuity at age 65 (retirement, reduced labor force participation, Medicare-analog programs, behavioral responses to approaching mortality). The paper correctly notes this elsewhere but then lapses into clean causal language at the policy-implication stage.

The same lapse appears in the Abstract:
> "institutional channels for transfer digitization being insufficient, on their own, to overcome the age gradient"

"Institutional channels for transfer digitization" are never directly observed in ENAHO — the paper observes the age-65 discontinuity. Whether it is the *institutional channel* that is insufficient or some other age-65 correlated change is not identified.

---

### [MAJOR-2] Upper bound on "program effect" ignores the take-up dilution factor

**Exact sentence (Discussion §6.1):**
> "the data support the conclusion that any positive effect of the program on digital adoption, if it exists, is smaller than approximately **3 percentage points in the pooled population**."

Three problems:

1. **"The program" vs. the ITT discontinuity.** The 3 pp figure is the upper bound on the *ITT* estimate — the average across all people crossing age 65, most of whom are not Pensión 65 beneficiaries. Take-up is approximately 75% among the eligible, and only ~22.5% of the age-65 population is jointly eligible (age ≥ 65 *and* SISFOH extreme-poor). The LATE on actual compliers could be many times larger. Bounding the program effect at 3 pp from an ITT estimate is not mathematically valid without an explicit Wald-style scaling.

2. **"In the pooled population."** The estimate is local — identified within ages 50–79 in the MSE-optimal bandwidth, without survey expansion weights. "Pooled population" implies national representativeness that the design does not deliver.

3. **"Positive effect."** The 3 pp bound covers the upper tail of the CI for the *rdrobust baseline*. The WLS covariate-adjusted estimate CI is entirely negative ([−0.0373, −0.0167]). The paper cannot simultaneously bound positive effects at 3 pp and report a precisely negative WLS CI without reconciling the two.

---

### [MAJOR-3] "First RDD evaluation, to our knowledge" — repeated unverifiable claim

This phrase appears in both the **Introduction** (§1, third paragraph) and the **Conclusion** (§6 first paragraph). The hedge "to our knowledge" does not convert an unverifiable claim into a verified one. No systematic literature search is reported. Given that (a) Pensión 65 has operated since 2011, (b) there is an active RDD literature on age-eligibility thresholds in Latin America, and (c) ENAHO microdata are publicly available, the probability that no prior applied economics working paper has examined related discontinuities is not established. If this claim cannot be verified, it should be dropped or softened to "we are not aware of."

---

### [MAJOR-4] WLS "fallback" presented as a robustness specification; its 2.4× wider bandwidth makes it a different estimand

**Exact text (Results §5.1):**
> "this covariate-adjusted specification uses a wider bandwidth (h = 34.2 years) and a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator implemented via statsmodels **as a fallback** when the local-polynomial rdrobust routine encountered memory limitations"

A method chosen because of computational constraints on a specific machine is not a robustness check — it is a forced methodological substitution with a fundamentally different estimand (local effect at the cutoff under h=14.2 vs. a smoothed average over ages 31–79 under h=34.2). The paper acknowledges the bandwidth difference but presents the WLS result in Table 2 alongside the rdrobust baseline as if they are comparable alternative specifications. The claim in the abstract that the covariate-adjusted estimate "is best read as describing the broader age-adoption profile rather than as a refined local effect at the cutoff" confirms the estimands differ — which means the WLS row of Table 2 should not appear as a robustness specification for the rdrobust ITT estimate.

---

### [MAJOR-5] McCrary density test statistic reported without p-value

**Exact sentence (§5.2):**
> "The McCrary-style density test of Cattaneo et al. (2018) produces a test statistic of 2.0"

A test statistic without a p-value or critical value is uninterpretable. Under the rddensity implementation for a variable with integer mass points, the reference distribution is not standard normal. The paper says "there is no evidence of bunching specifically at age 65" but provides no basis for that conclusion beyond asserting a test statistic of 2.0. Depending on the reference distribution, 2.0 may or may not cross conventional significance thresholds. The p-value must be reported.

---

### [MINOR-1] Mechanism claims asserted as explanations, not hypotheses

The paper's three substantive interpretations of the null result (§6.1) are presented with declarative confidence:

> "A null result on this margin would be consistent with prior literature on the dormancy of forced accounts."

> "the secular age gradient in technology adoption is steep enough at age 65 that any program-specific positive effect is overwhelmed by underlying cohort differences"

These are plausible narratives, not tested hypotheses. Neither dormancy (the Bachas et al. mechanism) nor cohort composition (the gradient mechanism) is directly identified in the ENAHO cross-section. The paper should flag these as candidate mechanisms, not as supported findings.

---

### [MINOR-2] "Would face few financial-inclusion incentives" asserted without evidence

**Exact sentence (§3.4, Institutional Background):**
> "The program therefore creates an institutional push toward digital onboarding for a population that, absent the program, **would face few financial-inclusion incentives**."

This claim is stated as established fact. Whether the elderly extreme-poor in Peru face "few" financial-inclusion incentives absent Pensión 65 depends on market structure, family remittances, informal labor, and access to other transfer programs — none of which are measured or cited here. The statement should be hedged: "…a population that arguably faces fewer financial-inclusion incentives from private-market sources."

---

### [MINOR-3] Permutation inference scope is ambiguous

The paper reports one randomization p-value (0.434) on the "primary outcome" and uses it to override the asymptotic WLS CI rejection. But it is not stated whether the permutation test was computed on the rdrobust statistic, the WLS statistic, or both. If it was computed only on the rdrobust statistic (the most natural reading), it does not logically override the WLS CI, and the dismissal of the WLS result as "asymptotic SEs understate uncertainty" remains an assertion rather than a demonstrated fact.

---

### [MINOR-4] Population mean of `USA_BILLETERA` is inconsistent with within-bandwidth mean

The paper states: "`USA_BILLETERA`: Population mean: 15.6%." But Table 1 (full sample) shows `USA_BILLETERA` mean = 17.94% for the control group and 3.19% for the treated group, and the within-bandwidth mean reported in the text is 12.4% (control) / 4.0% (treated). The "population mean" of 15.6% does not match either the full-sample weighted mean (which would require applying `FACTOR_EXPANSION`, noted as absent from the cleaned data in the Data Audit) or the bandwidth-restricted sample mean. The source of this figure should be clarified.

## 4. Mathematics, Equations & Notation

## Mathematical & Formal Review — Round 4

**Scope**: Full paper body is present for the first time (Round 3 was unreviable due to absent body text). I can now assess the formal content directly.

---

### 1. Equation Correctness and Specification

**[CRITICAL-1] Logical impossibility in reported population means**

Section 3.3 reports:
- `TIENE_BILLETERA` (ownership): population mean = **7.4%**
- `USA_BILLETERA` (active use): population mean = **15.6%**

Active use requires ownership by the paper's own causal logic ("ownership reflects access… active use reflects behavioral integration"). A person using a digital wallet as a payment channel must first own one. It is formally impossible that $P(\text{active use}) > P(\text{ownership})$ in the same population under these definitions.

The within-bandwidth figures are internally consistent (ownership 12.9% > use 12.4% for controls; 6.4% > 4.0% for treated), which makes the whole-sample reversal more suspicious—likely a mislabeling, a denominator mismatch between the two mean calculations, or an error in how `USA_BILLETERA` was constructed. The abstract repeats the ordering implicitly ("wallet ownership and use") without resolving the contradiction. A referee will catch this immediately.

---

**[MAJOR-1] Equation (3) omits the slope interaction — specification inconsistency with Equation (2)**

Equation (2) correctly specifies separate slopes on each side of the cutoff:

$$Y_i = \alpha + \tau D_i + \beta_1(A_i-65) + \beta_2 D_i(A_i-65) + \varepsilon_i$$

Equation (3) writes only:

$$Y_i = \alpha + \tau D_i + g(A_i-65) + \mathbf{X}_i'\boldsymbol{\gamma} + \varepsilon_i$$

The interaction $D_i \cdot g(A_i-65)$ is absent. As written, this constrains the polynomial to be identical on both sides of the cutoff — a pooled-slope restriction that is inconsistent with the local-linear RDD framework and with the Calonico et al. (2019) covariate-adjusted estimator the paper cites. A constrained common slope conflates the discontinuity $\tau$ with differential curvature across the cutoff. Either the equation should include $D_i \cdot g_1(A_i-65)$ or the text must defend the restriction explicitly.

---

**[MAJOR-2] Randomization inference procedure is non-standard for RDD and potentially invalid**

Section 4.3 states: *"for each of 500 random permutations of the treatment assignment within an age-window of [55, 75], we re-estimate τ."* 

Permuting $D_i = \mathbf{1}\{A_i \ge 65\}$ while holding age fixed destroys the structural feature of the RDD (that treatment is a deterministic function of the running variable), creating a null distribution that is only valid if the outcome is unrelated to age within $[55, 75]$. The paper itself documents a strong negative age gradient in wallet adoption, so this assumption fails by construction. The correct procedure for RDD randomization inference is to permute the **cutoff location** (placebo cutoffs), not treatment assignment. As a result, the reported $p = 0.434$ may reflect the size distortions of an inappropriate permutation scheme rather than genuine failure to reject the null. Placebo cutoffs are already reported in Table 3 and could serve this function with proper aggregation.

---

### 2. Minor Issues

**[MINOR-1] Inconsistent reporting of optimal bandwidth**

The MSE-optimal bandwidth is stated as $h^* = 14.24$ in the abstract, Section 3.2, Section 5.1, and Section 6.1, but written as $h^* = 14.2$ in Section 5.2. Should be standardized throughout.

**[MINOR-2] Equation (3): degree of $g(\cdot)$ unspecified**

The text calls $g(\cdot)$ a "flexible polynomial" without specifying the degree. The baseline uses $p=1$ (consistent with Equation (2)), but a reader comparing Equations (2) and (3) cannot infer this. Specifying $g(\cdot) = \beta_1(\cdot) + \beta_2 D_i(\cdot)$ for $p=1$, or stating the degree explicitly, removes the ambiguity.

**[MINOR-3] Equation (3) notation does not reflect the bandwidth change**

The covariate-adjusted specification uses $h = 34.2$ years, disclosed in Section 5.1. However, Equation (3) carries no bandwidth subscript or qualifier to distinguish it from Equation (2)'s $h^* = 14.24$ window. Writing $|A_i - 65| \le h_{\text{cov}}$ in Equation (3) and defining $h_{\text{cov}} = 34.2$ in the text would eliminate the ambiguity.

---

### 3. What Was Resolved from Round 3

The Round 3 review was limited to the three bibliography entries visible before truncation. With the full body now present:
- Equation (1)'s limit notation ($\downarrow$/$\uparrow$) is correct.
- Equation (2) specification is internally consistent.
- All three equation cross-references (`\ref{eq:itt}`, `\ref{eq:rdd}`, `\ref{eq:rdd_covariates}`) match their labels.
- The $t$-statistic claim ($-0.027/0.005 = -5.4$) is arithmetically correct.
- The covariate-adjusted CI arithmetic checks out: $-0.027 \pm 1.96 \times 0.005 = [-0.037, -0.017]$ ✓

The Round 3 table numerical inconsistencies (INTERNET_HOGAR appearing in both Table 3 and Table 4 with different $N$ and CI widths) remain **unverifiable** from `main.tex` alone since both tables are `\input{}` references — those files were not supplied.

# Pre-Submission Referee Report — Tables & Figures (Round 4)
**Date:** 2026-05-02 | **Target:** top-field

---

## Previously Raised Issues — Resolution Status

**Round 3 CRITICAL-1** (T3 Panel D vs T4 irreconcilable numbers): **RESOLVED.** Table 4 now carries a clear footnote — *"Slight numerical differences with Table~\ref{tab:robustness} Panel~D arise because Panel~D uses outcome-specific MSE-optimal bandwidths (15.23 / 14.29) while this table fixes the bandwidth at the primary outcome's h\*=14.24"* — that fully accounts for the discrepancy. No longer a problem.

**Round 3 MAJOR-1** (method switch undisclosed): **RESOLVED.** Table 2 now includes an explicit `Method` row for every specification (rdrobust / statsmodels\_WLS), BW is shown per row, and the partial table note confirms the WLS bandwidth is ~2.4× the MSE-optimal value.

---

## New Issues

---

### [CRITICAL-1] Table 2 baseline and Table 3 "H Optimal"/"Linear" differ for what must be the identical specification

Table 2 "baseline" and Table 3 Panel A "H Optimal" / Panel C "Linear" all label the same specification: local-linear rdrobust, `TIENE_BILLETERA`, BW = 14.24, N = 27,809, point estimate = −0.0056. Yet the reported SEs and CIs diverge:

| Source | SE | 95% CI | CI width |
|---|---|---|---|
| Table 2 baseline | 0.0165 | [−0.0336, 0.0310] | 0.0646 |
| Table 3 H Optimal | 0.0179 | [−0.0397, 0.0306] | 0.0703 |
| Table 3 Panel C Linear | 0.0179 | [−0.0397, 0.0306] | 0.0703 |

The SE discrepancy is 8.5% and the CI widths differ by ~9%. This cannot arise from rounding. The most likely cause is that the two tables were generated by rdrobust calls with different `vce` parameters or different `nnmatch` settings. A referee who compares the two tables directly will halt immediately. The numbers must be made identical — whichever call is correct should be used everywhere.

---

### [CRITICAL-2] Section 4.2 misstates the ±1.0-year donut-hole estimate

Section 4.2 reads: *"Donut-hole specifications excluding observations within ±0.5 and ±1.0 years of the cutoff yield estimates of −0.001, removing the small negative point estimate entirely."*

Table 3 Panel B shows:

| Donut | Estimate |
|---|---|
| ±0.5 yr | −0.0001 ≈ −0.001 ✓ |
| ±1.0 yr | **−0.0122** ✗ |
| ±2.0 yr | +0.0154 (sign flip; not mentioned in text) |

The ±1.0-year estimate (−0.012) is twelve times larger in magnitude than the text claims, exceeds the baseline in absolute value, and does not "remove" anything. The text is factually wrong for this specification. The ±2.0-year donut, which actually flips sign, is unmentioned anywhere in the paper. Both errors must be corrected.

---

### [MAJOR-1] Table 1 retains literal `---` placeholder columns throughout

The column spec `l cccc cccc` allocates four sub-columns per group, but the fourth is headed `---` and every data cell in that column also reads `---`:

```latex
Variable & Mean & SD & N & --- & Mean & SD & N & --- \\
TIENE_BILLETERA & 0.0535 & 0.2251 & 14088 & --- & 0.0800 & 0.2713 & 99667 & --- \\
```

This is an unfilled code placeholder. Either populate it with a meaningful statistic (Min/Max, p25/p75, or a difference test) or delete the column and reformat as `l ccc ccc`. As submitted, the table will confuse any reader who asks what `---` represents.

---

### [MAJOR-2] Three major robustness results cited in the body text have no table entry

Section 4.2 and the abstract report three test results that are absent from all four tables:

| Test | Body text claim | Table |
|---|---|---|
| Permutation inference | *p* = 0.434 | Absent |
| Cattaneo et al. density test | *t* = 2.0 | Absent |
| Placebo cutoffs (age 15 and 53) | −0.007 [−0.008, −0.006] and +0.008 [−0.018, 0.040] | Absent |

For a top-field submission, every robustness claim must appear in a table. Table 3 ("Robustness Checks") is the natural home. At minimum, add Panels E–G covering permutation inference, density test, and placebo cutoffs. Prose-only reporting of these tests will not survive peer review at a top journal.

---

### [MAJOR-3] Table 2's "extended\_covariates" specification is not described anywhere in the body text

Table 2 contains three specification blocks — "baseline," "with\_covariates," and **"extended\_covariates"** (N = 57,039 / BW = 33.46, Method = statsmodels\_WLS). The third specification does not appear in Section 3 (Estimation Equations), Section 4 (Results), the abstract, or anywhere else in the manuscript. The sample drops by 2,610 observations relative to "with\_covariates" (N = 59,649 → 57,039), suggesting additional covariates with missing values, but the reader has no way to verify this. Either (a) add a description of the extended covariate set in Section 3 and interpret the estimates in Section 4, or (b) remove the row — leaving an unexplained, unlabeled specification in the main results table is not acceptable.

---

### [MAJOR-4] Table 3 "H Double" CI is not centered on the reported point estimate, with no explanatory note

Table 3 Panel A:

| Spec | Estimate | SE | 95% CI | CI midpoint |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H Half | −0.0056 | 0.0221 | [−0.0499, 0.0370] | −0.0065 ≈ estimate ✓ |
| H Optimal | −0.0056 | 0.0179 | [−0.0397, 0.0306] | −0.0046 ≈ estimate ✓ |
| **H Double** | **−0.0204** | 0.0137 | **[−0.0272, +0.0264]** | **−0.0004 ≠ estimate** |

The CI midpoint for H Double is essentially zero, a full 0.020 away from the conventional point estimate. For H Half and H Optimal the CIs are approximately centered on their estimates; for H Double they are not. This arises because rdrobust reports a conventional (pre-bias-correction) point estimate but a bias-corrected robust CI, and at the wider bandwidth the bias correction is large. This is technically correct rdrobust behavior, but without a note a reader who sees Estimate = −0.020 and CI = [−0.027, +0.026] will find the table internally incoherent (the upper bound of +0.026 lies 0.046 above the estimate). A sentence in the table footnote must explain that point estimates are conventional rdrobust estimates while CIs are bias-corrected and robust, and may diverge substantially from the conventional estimate at wide bandwidths.

---

### [MINOR-1] Table 1: NIVEL\_EDUCATIVO sample-size drop unexplained in notes

The table's group totals are 14,088 (treated) and 99,667 (control), but NIVEL\_EDUCATIVO has N = 13,793 and N = 92,826 — implying 295 missing observations in the treated group and **6,841 missing (6.9%) in the control group**. The table notes should state that means for this variable are computed on the non-missing subsample.

---

### [MINOR-2] Table 1 does not disclose whether means are survey-weighted

The text cites population means of 7.4% (TIENE\_BILLETERA) and 15.6% (USA\_BILLETERA), but the unweighted calculations implied by Table 1 yield approximately 7.7% and 16.1%. The discrepancy is consistent with survey-expansion-factor weighting for the text figures and unweighted cell means in the table. Table 1's notes should state explicitly whether means are unweighted sample means.

---

### [MINOR-3] Table 2: SISFOH heterogeneity rows omit bandwidth (inconsistent with all other rows)

The baseline row shows "N / BW = 27,809 / 14.24" and the internet-heterogeneity rows show "N / BW = 16,580 / 16.53," but the three SISFOH subgroup rows show only `N_eff` with no bandwidth. Section 4.5 (extreme-poor subsample) states h\* = 14.5 for the extreme-poor subsample. BW should be added to all three SISFOH rows for consistency and reproducibility.

---

### [MINOR-4] Table 2: USA\_BILLETERA "---" cells for all SISFOH subgroups carry no table-level explanation

The entire USA\_BILLETERA column for all three SISFOH subgroups is suppressed as "---." The reason (degenerate inference because essentially zero extreme-poor individuals aged 65–75 report active wallet use) is explained in a dedicated paragraph in Section 4.3, but the table itself has no footnote to this effect. A reader examining Table 2 in isolation will not understand why a full column is missing. Add a table note cross-referencing the explanation.

---

### [MINOR-5] Figure captions editorialise rather than describe

Three figure captions state conclusions rather than describing what is plotted:

- Figure 1: *"There is no visible discontinuity at the cutoff."*
- Figure 2: *"The estimates are stable and confidence intervals consistently cover zero."*
- Figure 3: *"there is no evidence of bunching specifically at age 65."*

Journal style requires captions to describe the figure; conclusions belong in the body text. Replace each editorial sentence with a neutral description (e.g., for Figure 3: "The Cattaneo et al. (2018) density test statistic is 2.0; integer-age mass points are visible but no excess density at age 65 is apparent.").

## 6. Contribution Evaluation

## Referee Report

**Paper:** "Does Crossing the Pensión 65 Eligibility Threshold Increase Digital Wallet Adoption? A Regression Discontinuity Analysis with ENAHO 2024"

---

### Part 1 — Central Contribution

The paper provides the first regression-discontinuity estimate of the association between Pensión 65 eligibility and digital wallet adoption in Peru, using the 2024 ENAHO wave—the first to separately identify wallet ownership and use—and documents a precisely estimated null intent-to-treat effect across multiple robustness checks.

**Rating: Incremental.** The contribution is real: the data moment is genuinely new (2024 ENAHO is the first survey wave with wallet-level granularity), the null is policy-informative, and the identification is more credible than typical OLS comparisons. However, the finding—that a pension program's digital disbursement channel alone does not shift broader wallet adoption among the elderly poor—is largely anticipated by the existing literature on dormant forced accounts (Bachas et al., 2018; Muralidharan & Niehaus, 2016). The incremental rating reflects methodological rigor on a question the literature had partly pre-answered theoretically.

---

### Part 2 — Identification and Credibility

**Variation used:** A sharp RDD exploiting the age-65 administrative eligibility cutoff for Pensión 65. The paper correctly characterizes this as an ITT design: the threshold is sharp on age, but actual program receipt requires additionally meeting the SISFOH extreme-poverty criterion, which the authors cannot observe in ENAHO.

**Plausible exogeneity:** The age cutoff is institutionally hard and predetermined. The McCrary density test and placebo covariate checks appear to confirm design integrity, and the randomization inference p-value of 0.434 is comfortably null. The running variable is large ($N = 113{,}755$; $N = 27{,}809$ within the MSE-optimal bandwidth), and the CI bounds are tight ($[-0.034, 0.031]$), so the null is precisely estimated, not powered-down.

**Primary threat not fully addressed — Discrete running variable.** Age is reported in completed years, meaning the running variable is discrete with mass points at each integer. Standard `rdrobust` estimators assume continuity of the density of the running variable; with integer ages, this assumption is violated. The Kolesar & Rothe (2018, *Review of Economics and Statistics*) honest confidence intervals for discrete running variables are the methodological standard when the number of support points is finite. The authors use the Cattaneo et al. (2018) density test designed for continuous running variables and do not acknowledge or correct for the discreteness. This is the most credible identification concern not addressed in the text.

**Secondary threat — No first stage.** The paper cannot observe SISFOH classification status for ENAHO respondents. It therefore cannot compute a first-stage estimate (share of age-65-crossers who are actually SISFOH-eligible and receive the pension) or scale the ITT to a LATE. While the ITT framing is explicitly and correctly adopted, the authors cannot rule out that the ITT is null because take-up among SISFOH-eligible individuals near the cutoff is too low for a signal to appear, rather than because the program channel itself is ineffective. A back-of-envelope calculation using administrative coverage figures (750,000 beneficiaries ≈ 30% of age 65+) would help bound this.

**Contamination of the age-65 cutoff.** Peru has at least one other age-based institutional change at 65—mandatory retirement under the private pension (AFP) system for workers who elect programmatic or early retirement. If AFP-related income shocks or banking interactions co-occur at exactly age 65 in a subpopulation, the ITT captures a compound effect. The paper does not address this alternative pathway.

---

### Part 3 — Required and Suggested Analyses

**Required [CRITICAL]:**

None that would cause an outright desk reject. The design is credible, the null is precisely estimated, and the robustness battery is extensive. However, the following issues require substantive revision before submission to a top-field journal.

**Major [MAJOR]:**

1. **[MAJOR] Discrete running variable correction.** The authors must either (a) implement Kolesar-Rothe (2018) honest CIs for discrete running variables, or (b) demonstrate that the results are unchanged under a "donut of one year" around each integer mass point, or (c) provide a formal argument for why the standard `rdrobust` inference is valid in this setting. Failing to address discreteness in a top-field submission will be caught by every technically competent referee.

2. **[MAJOR] Covariate-adjusted estimate vs. local-linear baseline discrepancy.** The baseline ITT is $-0.006$ (SE $= 0.016$); the covariate-adjusted estimate is $-0.027$ (SE $= 0.005$). The authors attribute this gap to a wider bandwidth in the adjusted specification. If so, the robustness curve across bandwidths should show the baseline estimate drifting to $-0.027$ as bandwidth widens — this should be plotted explicitly. The current text briefly flags the issue but does not resolve it. A reader cannot judge whether the covariate-adjusted result reflects genuine heterogeneity in the age-adoption profile or a bandwidth-driven artifact.

3. **[MAJOR] Template boilerplate in output tables.** The code review reports that Table 1's footnote references "municipality-elections where the party's vote share exceeded the electoral threshold" and Figure 1's x-axis is labeled "Vote Margin." These are not typographic errors — they are unrevised artifacts from an electoral RDD template. A paper reaching a top-field journal with these passages visible will receive an immediate desk reject on presentation grounds alone. This must be corrected unconditionally.

4. **[MAJOR] No minimum detectable effect (MDE) or power analysis.** A null result is more persuasive when the authors demonstrate that their design was powered to detect economically meaningful effects. Given the within-bandwidth means (ownership: 12.9% control / 6.4% treated), the authors should report the MDE at 80% power for the primary outcome and argue that the effect the program could plausibly produce is smaller. The current text asserts "precisely estimated null" but does not benchmark precision against a substantive effect size.

**Suggested:**

5. **[Suggested]** Quantify the first-stage using administrative coverage statistics. Even an external estimate of the share of ENAHO respondents aged 65–75 who are SISFOH-classified extreme poor would allow a rough scaling of the ITT to bound the LATE. This would substantially enrich the policy discussion.

6. **[Suggested]** Heterogeneity by urban/rural and by department-level digital infrastructure. The null might conceal positive effects in areas with better smartphone penetration or Yape/Plin coverage. The bandwidth sample spans all 25 departments; a split by \texttt{AREA} (urban vs. rural) or by BCRP financial-density quintile would be informative and is standard in the financial-inclusion literature.

7. **[Suggested]** Falsification on a placebo outcome where Pensión 65 has no channel: e.g., ownership of a traditional savings account at a commercial bank (P558E1 codes other than 9). If the RDD also shows no discontinuity on that outcome, the design is confirmed; if it shows a positive effect, it would suggest broader financial-access effects from crossing age 65 that contaminate the wallet interpretation.

---

### Part 4 — Literature Positioning

The citations are appropriate and the framing is honest. The connection to Bachas et al. (2018), Muralidharan & Niehaus (2016), and Jack & Suri (2014)/Suri (2017) is well-motivated and the theoretical null is correctly anticipated. The claim that \citet{aizenman2022} is the "closest application" is asserted without enough detail for a referee to verify the comparison; the authors should be more specific about how the sample, design, and outcomes differ.

One gap: the paper does not cite the literature on age gradients in digital adoption (e.g., Lusardi & Mitchell 2014 on financial literacy among older adults; Czaja et al. on technology adoption among seniors). Given that the paper's null is attributed partly to an "age gradient in digital financial behavior," anchoring that interpretation in a specific literature would strengthen the discussion section.

---

### Part 5 — Journal Fit and Recommendation

For a **top-field journal** (AER, QJE, JPE, AEJ:Applied, AEJ:Policy), the bar is high. The paper is methodologically disciplined and the null is precisely documented, but the contribution is incremental (Peru-specific, single program, anticipated null), the discrete running variable issue is unaddressed, and the output tables contain template artifacts. At a specialist journal (Journal of Development Economics, World Development, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management), this paper would be competitive after revision.

**Recommendation: Revise before sending.**

The required analyses (items 1–4 above) are all addressable in a standard revision cycle and none requires new data collection. If the authors respond adequately, particularly on the discrete running variable and the covariate-adjustment discrepancy, the paper would be suitable for a second round at a field journal.

---

### Part 6 — Questions to the Authors

1. **Discrete running variable:** Age in ENAHO is recorded as completed years — an integer-valued variable. Standard `rdrobust` inference assumes a continuous density of the running variable. Why did you not apply the Kolesar-Rothe (2018) honest confidence interval procedure, or at minimum report sensitivity to this concern? How do your CIs change under that correction?

2. **Covariate-adjusted vs. local-linear discrepancy:** The baseline ITT on ownership is $-0.006$ (SE $= 0.016$) while the covariate-adjusted estimate is $-0.027$ (SE $= 0.005$) — a difference of 21 percentage points in point estimates and a threefold difference in precision. You attribute this to a wider bandwidth in the adjusted specification. Can you plot the bandwidth-sensitivity curve for the baseline (no covariates) and show that the point estimate drifts to $-0.027$ at the wider bandwidth? If it does not, what explains the difference?

3. **First stage and LATE interpretation:** You estimate an ITT but cannot observe SISFOH classification. Using your figure of 750,000 beneficiaries representing approximately 30% of Peruvians aged 65+, what is your best estimate of the first-stage compliance rate among observations in the bandwidth window? Does scaling the ITT by this compliance rate produce an effect that is still economically negligible, or does it become non-trivial?

4. **AFP retirement at age 65:** Peru's private pension system (AFP Ley 26790 / DL 25897) contains provisions that interact with age 65 — including the right to elect early retirement and the standard programmatic retirement age. Is there evidence from your data (e.g., labor market exit, AFP-related income variables in ENAHO module 5) that AFP-related transitions co-occur at exactly age 65 in your sample? If so, how do you separate the Pensión 65 ITT from AFP-driven effects on the financial behavior of this subpopulation?

5. **Table notes and figure labels:** Table 1's footnote mentions "municipality-elections where the party's vote share exceeded the electoral threshold" and Figure 1 is labeled "Vote Margin." Can you confirm these are typographic artifacts and provide the corrected versions of all affected tables and figures?

6. **MDE and power:** What is the minimum detectable effect size (at 80% power, two-sided 5% level) for your primary outcome within the MSE-optimal bandwidth? Is this MDE smaller than the effect size a policy analyst would consider economically meaningful for a program reaching 750,000 beneficiaries?

7. **Urban/rural heterogeneity:** Digital wallet adoption is highly concentrated in urban areas (the BCRP 2024 figures you cite refer overwhelmingly to metropolitan areas). Given that Pensión 65 disproportionately reaches rural extreme-poor elderly, is the null driven by a rural subpopulation with structurally zero wallet adoption regardless of the program? A simple split by \texttt{AREA} within your bandwidth sample would clarify whether the null is uniform or concentrated.
