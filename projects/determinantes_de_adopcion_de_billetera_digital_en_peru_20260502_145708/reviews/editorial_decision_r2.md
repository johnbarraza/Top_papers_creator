## CODE ISSUES (require re-running scripts)

These issues require modifying Python scripts and re-executing them.
After fixing scripts, re-run ALL scripts to regenerate results,
then update main.tex with the new numbers.

1. [SHOULD] [Contribution] Fix covariate-adjusted specification to use h*=14.2 bandwidth by pre-restricting sample to ages 50-80 before calling rdrobust; current WLS fallback with h=34.2 is a different estimand, not a robustness check
2. [SHOULD] [Contribution] Heterogeneity by SISFOH poverty classification: estimate RDD separately for extreme-poor vs. non-extreme-poor subsamples to test the core mechanism
3. [SHOULD] [Contribution] Report expansion-factor-weighted population means for outcomes and clarify whether RDD estimates use survey weights
4. [SHOULD] [Math] Arithmetic error: paper explicitly states 't ≈ -5.1, computed as -0.027/0.005' but -0.027/0.005 = -5
5. [SHOULD] [Tables/Figures] Table 3 Panel B: donut-hole estimates for 0.5-year and 1.0-year exclusions are byte-for-byte identic
6. [SHOULD] [Tables/Figures] Permutation randomization p-value (p=0.434) — the primary inference result — appears only in prose; 
7. [SHOULD] [Tables/Figures] McCrary density test statistic (T=2.0) reported in text but absent from all tables and figures
8. [SHOULD] [Referee Question] Does ENAHO 2024 record Pensión 65 receipt? If so, what is the first-stage RDD estimate of the take-up jump at age 65 wit
9. [SHOULD] [Referee Question] Can you rerun the covariate-adjusted local-polynomial specification on a pre-restricted sample of ages 50-80 to avoid th
10. [SHOULD] [Referee Question] Can you show the full permutation distribution of the WLS t-statistic and confirm that the empirical t≈-5.4 falls within

## TEXT ISSUES (edit main.tex)

These issues require editing the paper text only.

1. [MUST] [Contribution] First-stage discontinuity in Pensión 65 take-up at age 65 must be shown or demonstrated to be infeasible with available data
2. [MUST] [Contribution] Sharp vs. fuzzy design must be resolved: either recharacterize as fuzzy RDD with ITT and scaled LATE, or demonstrate SISFOH share is continuous through the cutoff; remove LATE label from Equation (1)
3. [MUST] [Contribution] Replace full-sample Table 1 with bandwidth-restricted summary statistics (ages within h*=14.2 of the cutoff); the current table is misleading about who the identifying comparison is between
4. [MUST] [Claims] Causal overclaiming: These findings imply that institutional digitization of government transfers, on its own, is an insu

13. [SHOULD] [Contribution] Correct all electoral-RDD boilerplate in table notes and figure labels before resubmission; code review confirms these artifacts survive in the output pipeline

## MAY-ADDRESS (polish)

1. [Style] CRITICAL: Fig. 1 description states rates 'rise from age 50 to age 35' — logically inverted; age 35 
2. [Style] MAJOR: 'Importantly' in §5.1 (Main Results, ¶2) violates journal style — delete or rephrase.
3. [Style] MAJOR: 'centred' (British) vs. 'centered' (American) used inconsistently — standardize to 'centered'
4. [Style] MAJOR: Banerjee et al. bibliography entry carries year label '2019' but citation key and inline date
5. [Style] MAJOR: §6.2 Limitations announces five limitations but only two have bold headers; the remaining thr
6. [Style] MAJOR: 'Existing literature is insufficient on two fronts' (§1) — literature is not 'insufficient'; 

## REFEREE QUESTIONS (must answer in revised paper)

1. Does ENAHO 2024 record Pensión 65 receipt? If so, what is the first-stage RDD estimate of the take-up jump at age 65 within the optimal bandwidth?
2. How do you justify calling the design sharp when only SISFOH-classified extreme-poor individuals aged 65+ are eligible, meaning the treatment probability jump at the cutoff is substantially below 1?
3. Can you rerun the covariate-adjusted local-polynomial specification on a pre-restricted sample of ages 50-80 to avoid the memory constraint while preserving local identification?
4. Is there evidence that SISFOH poverty classification itself is continuous at age 65, or could age-related reclassification introduce a discontinuity in the running variable's joint distribution with poverty status?
5. Can you show the full permutation distribution of the WLS t-statistic and confirm that the empirical t≈-5.4 falls within the null distribution, making the randomization p=0.434 credible?
6. Were the electoral-RDD boilerplate labels in Table 4 and Figure 1 corrected in the submitted version, or do those artifacts survive in the actual output files?
7. Given that the identifying variation is local to ages 51-79 (h*=14.2) and the population of interest is elderly extreme-poor Peruvians, do the authors view this as a top-field submission or a field-journal submission, and how do they frame the contribution accordingly?
