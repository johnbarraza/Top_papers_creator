## Formal Review: Mathematical and Notation Analysis

---

### 1. Mathematical Correctness

**Equation (1) — LATE estimand**

$$\tau = \lim_{a \downarrow 65} E[Y \mid A = a] - \lim_{a \uparrow 65} E[Y \mid A = a]$$

Direction is correct: right limit minus left limit. Standard sharp-RDD estimand. ✓

**Equation (2) — Local-linear baseline**

$$Y_i = \alpha + \tau D_i + \beta_1 (A_i - 65) + \beta_2 D_i (A_i - 65) + \varepsilon_i$$

Correct: the $\beta_2 D_i(A_i - 65)$ term allows separate slopes on each side. ✓

---

### 2. Equation (3) — Missing slope interaction [MAJOR]

The covariate-adjusted specification is written:

$$Y_i = \alpha + \tau D_i + g(A_i - 65) + \mathbf{X}_i' \boldsymbol{\gamma} + \varepsilon_i$$

The polynomial $g(A_i - 65)$ is a **single function** of the running variable, forcing the same slope on both sides of the cutoff. Equation (2) explicitly allows separate slopes via the $D_i(A_i-65)$ interaction. Standard RDD practice — and specifically the Calonico et al. (2014) method cited — fits separate polynomials on each side. The correct specification should be $g(A_i - 65, D_i)$ or equivalently include $D_i \cdot p(A_i - 65)$ terms. As written, Equation (3) is inconsistent with Equation (2) and with the cited methodology.

### 3. Arithmetic Error in Explicit Computation [MAJOR]

Section 5.1 states:

> "the $t$-statistic computed in the asymptotic covariate-adjusted WLS specification ($t \approx -5.1$, computed as $-0.027/0.005$)"

$$\frac{-0.027}{0.005} = -5.4 \neq -5.1$$

The paper explicitly derives the value inline, making this a verifiable arithmetic error, not a rounding issue. The correct value is $-5.4$.

### 4. Inconsistent Characterization of Galiani et al. (2020) [MAJOR]

The same paper is described differently in two places:

- **Introduction**: "find positive but heterogeneous effects of conditional cash transfer digitization on financial behavior in Argentina"
- **Section 2.3**: "document weak downstream behavioral effects of forced account openings on saving and active financial behavior"

"Positive" and "weak downstream" are contradictory characterizations. A reader using either passage to set priors about the literature will receive conflicting signals. One of these must be corrected or reconciled.

---

### 5. Orphan Bibliography Entry [MAJOR]

The bibliography contains:

```latex
\bibitem[Deming and Noray(2023)]{deming2023}
Deming, D.~J. and Noray, K. (2023). Earnings Dynamics...
```

The key `deming2023` is never cited anywhere in the text. This is an uncleaned entry from a prior draft. Beyond aesthetics, it inflates the apparent literature engagement and may trigger questions from referees.

---

### 6. Banerjee bibitem Label–Year Mismatch [MAJOR]

```latex
\bibitem[Banerjee et~al.2019]{banerjee2020}
Banerjee, A., Niehaus, P., and Suri, T. (2020). ...
```

The natbib label in brackets reads `2019`; the bibliography text says `(2020)`; the key is `banerjee2020`. When rendered, `\citet{banerjee2020}` will display "Banerjee et al.2019" while the bibliography entry says 2020. The in-text citation and bibliography will visibly disagree. Compare with the correctly formatted `\bibitem[Bachas et~al.(2018)]{bachas2018}`.

---

### 7. Undefined Notation: Potential Outcomes [MINOR]

The identifying assumptions (Section 4.1) introduce $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$:

> "$E[Y(0) \mid A = a]$ and $E[Y(1) \mid A = a]$ are continuous..."

These potential outcome random variables are never defined. Given that the estimand in Equation (1) uses $Y$ (not $Y(0), Y(1)$), a brief definition — e.g., "where $Y(d)$ denotes the potential outcome under treatment status $d \in \{0,1\}$" — is needed before first use.

---

### 8. Bandwidth Arithmetic Discrepancy [MINOR]

Section 5.2 states: "$h^*/2 = 7.1$, $h^* = 14.2$, and $2h^* = 28.5$"

$$2 \times 14.2 = 28.4 \neq 28.5$$

Consistent with $h^* = 14.25$ (unrounded), but since the paper reports $h^* = 14.2$, the double-bandwidth should be stated as 28.4.

---

### 9. bibitem Format Inconsistency [MINOR]

The natbib manual specifies `\bibitem[short(year)]{key}` for author-year mode. Several entries are missing parentheses around the year:

- `\bibitem[Ardington et~al.2016]{ardington2016}` — should be `[Ardington et~al.(2016)]`
- `\bibitem[Banerjee et~al.2019]{banerjee2020}` — see issue #6 above

Compare correctly formatted entries: `[Bachas et~al.(2018)]`, `[Battistin et~al.(2009)]`. Inconsistent formatting may cause natbib to render citations differently across entries.

---

### 10. Cohen's *d* Slight Discrepancy [MINOR]

The paper reports Cohen's $d = -0.021$. For a binary outcome with population mean $\bar{p} = 0.074$:

$$\text{SD} = \sqrt{0.074 \times 0.926} \approx 0.262, \quad d = \frac{-0.006}{0.262} \approx -0.023$$

The reported value of $-0.021$ could use a slightly different SD (e.g., the within-bandwidth SD rather than the population SD), but the computation basis is not stated.

---

### 11. Figure 1 Caption — Directional Confusion [MINOR]

Section 5.5 writes: "rates rise from approximately 4% at age 50 to a maximum of 11% near age 35 (younger adults), and decline monotonically with age."

The phrase "rise from age 50 to age 35" describes movement in the direction of *decreasing* age, which is non-standard in time-series or cross-sectional description. A clearer formulation: "ownership rates peak at approximately 11% near age 35 and decline monotonically with age, reaching approximately 4% by age 50." The current wording also places the global maximum at age 35 — unusual for a figure nominally centered on the age-65 cutoff; clarify whether the RD plot spans ages 35–75 or a narrower window.
