## 1. Spelling, Grammar & Style

## Copy-Edit Report — *Does Crossing the Pensión 65 Eligibility Threshold Increase Digital Wallet Adoption?*

---

### CRITICAL

**C1. Unfilled citation placeholder — Section 2.3, final paragraph of §2.3**
> "The closest recent application to our setting… documents weak first-stage effects on digital savings [CITATION MISSING — insert \citet{} key]."

A raw editorial note was left in the manuscript. The entire sentence must either be filled with a real citation or deleted before submission.

---

**C2. Both placebo cutoffs listed as "age 53" — Section 5.2**
> "Placebo cutoffs at age 53 (i.e., 12 years below the true cutoff) and age 53 (12 years right)…"

The right-side placebo is stated as "age 53" in both occurrences. Given the parenthetical "12 years right," the intended value is age 77 (65 + 12). This must be corrected; as written it renders the robustness check uninterpretable.

---

**C3. Logically incoherent figure caption / description — Section 5.5**
> "rates rise from approximately 4% at age 50 to a maximum of 11% near age 35 (younger adults), and decline monotonically with age."

Age 35 is *younger* than age 50; rates cannot simultaneously rise from age 50 to age 35 and also decline monotonically with age. The intended reading is almost certainly the reverse — rates peak among younger adults (≈ age 30–35) and *decline* toward age 50 and beyond, reaching ≈ 4% near the cutoff. Rewrite to reflect the actual profile shown in the figure.

---

**C4. Likely citation mismatch — Section 2.2**
> "\citet{banerjee2020} find that direct benefit transfers in Indonesia increase savings only when accompanied by financial-literacy components."

The listed reference for this key is Banerjee, Niehaus & Suri (2020), *Universal Basic Income in the Developing World*, *Annual Review of Economics* 11:959–983 — a general review article that does not contain an Indonesia-specific finding on digital transfers and savings. Verify whether this cite should point to a different paper (e.g., a World Bank study on PKH or Kartu Prakerja) and update accordingly.

---

**C5. Bibitem label/body year inconsistencies — References**

Two entries have mismatched years between the `\bibitem[…]` label and the body of the entry:

| Entry | Label year | Body year |
|---|---|---|
| `ardington2016` | 2009 | 2016 |
| `banerjee2020` | 2019 | 2020 |

For `natbib`, the bracketed label controls how the in-text citation renders. These inconsistencies will produce wrong in-text dates. Also note that the body of the Ardington entry lists volume 8(1):22–48, whereas the well-known Ardington, Case & Hosegood paper on labor supply responses in South Africa appeared in *AEJAE* **1**(1):22–48 (2009) — the volume number appears incorrect.

---

### MAJOR

**M1. Wrong word: "insufficient" — Section 1, penultimate paragraph**
> "Existing literature is insufficient on two fronts."

"Insufficient" means *inadequate in quality or quantity*; the authors mean the literature *does not address* these topics, not that it is of poor quality. Replace with "The existing literature is sparse on two fronts" or "The literature is silent on two fronts."

---

**M2. British / American spelling inconsistency — Abstract vs. Section 5.1**
> Abstract: "both estimates are tightly bounded and **centred** on zero."
> Section 5.1: "The estimate is **centered** very close to zero."

Choose one convention and apply it throughout. American ("centered") is standard for U.S. journals; British ("centred") for UK journals.

---

**M3. Redundant compound "urban metropolitan" — Section 1**
> "with explosive growth concentrated in **urban metropolitan** areas."

Metropolitan already denotes urban. Use either "urban areas" or "metropolitan areas."

---

**M4. Vague pronoun "this" after semicolon — Section 3.5**
> "The age-65 eligibility threshold is administratively sharp; **this** provides a natural experiment…"

"This" has no explicit antecedent. Rewrite: "This sharp threshold provides a natural experiment for estimating…"

---

**M5. Non-standard collocation "absorbs into" — Section 5.1**
> "the secular age-related trend that **absorbs into** the nonparametric estimator at the optimal bandwidth."

"Absorbs into" is not idiomatic here. Use "is absorbed by the nonparametric estimator" or "is captured by the nonparametric fit."

---

**M6. Incorrect punctuation: semicolon before subordinating "while" — Section 5.2**
> "produces a test statistic of 2.0**; while** the implementation flags mass-points at integer ages…"

A semicolon cannot precede a subordinating conjunction that opens a dependent clause. Break into two sentences: "…produces a test statistic of 2.0. While the implementation flags mass-points at integer ages, inspection of…"

---

**M7. Colloquial idiom in results — Section 5.4**
> "institutional eligibility does not **move the dial** on digital adoption in any observable subgroup."

"Move the dial" is informal. Replace with "has no detectable effect on" or "does not measurably shift."

---

**M8. Informal register in policy section — Section 6.2**
> "Policymakers **betting on** transfer digitization as a primary financial-inclusion lever…"

"Betting on" is too casual for a policy-implications paragraph. Use "relying on" or "counting on."

---

**M9. Grammatically awkward "policy attention on… should focus" — Section 6.2**
> "policy attention **on** the elderly poor population should focus on the underlying determinants…"

"Policy attention on X should focus on Y" is awkward and produces a doubled "on." Rewrite: "policy directed at the elderly poor should target the underlying determinants…"

---

**M10. Non-parallel structure in future-research list — Section 7**
> "(i) merging Pensión 65 administrative data…; (ii) panel data tracking the same individuals…; (iii) evaluation of complementary policies…"

Items (i) and (iii) are gerund phrases; item (ii) is a bare noun phrase. Revise to "(ii) collecting panel data to track the same individuals over time" to restore parallelism.

---

### MINOR

**m1. Non-standard preposition in "transactions outside cash" — Section 1**
> "roughly one in five adult transactions **outside cash** involved a digital wallet."

"Outside cash" is non-standard. Use "non-cash transactions" or "transactions excluding cash."

---

**m2. Unnecessary hyphen in "age-window" — Section 4.3**
> "within **an age-window** of $[55, 75]$."

No hyphen needed in an attributive noun phrase when the first element is itself a noun. Write "an age window."

---

**m3. Unhyphenated "cashout point" — Section 6.1**
> "beneficiaries treat the disbursement account as a passive **cashout** point."

Hyphenate: "cash-out point."

---

**m4. Unusual phrasing "bear emphasis" — Section 6.2**
> "Three limitations **bear emphasis**."

"Bear emphasis" is not idiomatic. Prefer "Three limitations merit emphasis" or "We note three limitations."

---

**m5. Redundant "the act of" — Section 3.4**
> "they are not affected by **the act of** crossing the eligibility threshold."

"The act of" adds no information. Delete: "they are not affected by crossing the eligibility threshold."

---

**m6. Informal "headline numbers" — Section 2.2**
> "downstream effects… are smaller than **headline numbers** suggest."

"Headline numbers" is informal. Use "aggregate estimates" or "top-line figures."

---

**m7. Awkward "passed through" for digital-platform users — Section 2.1**
> "more than 50% of monthly active adult users of any digital channel **passed through** one of these three platforms."

"Passed through" suggests transit rather than usage. Use "transacted through" or "used" or "were active on."

---

**m8. Inconsistent \bibitem label formatting — References**

Some entries parenthesize the year in the label (`\bibitem[Bachas et~al.(2018)]`) while others do not (`\bibitem[Ardington et~al.2009]`, `\bibitem[Banerjee et~al.2019]`). The `natbib` `authoryear` style requires consistent formatting. Standardize across all entries.

## 2. Internal Consistency & Cross-References

## Internal Coherence Review — Pensión 65 RDD Paper

---

### 1. Numerical Consistency: Text vs. Evidence Packet

**Abstract / Introduction / Section 5 — Baseline estimates**

| Quantity | Text | Table 2 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline TIENE_BILLETERA estimate | −0.006 | −0.0056 | ✓ |
| Baseline TIENE_BILLETERA SE | 0.016 | 0.0165 | ✓ |
| Baseline TIENE_BILLETERA 95% CI | [−0.034, 0.031] | [−0.0336, 0.0310] | ✓ |
| Baseline USA_BILLETERA estimate | +0.007 | 0.0066 | ✓ |
| Baseline USA_BILLETERA SE | 0.018 | 0.0180 | ✓ |
| Baseline USA_BILLETERA 95% CI | [−0.034, 0.037] | [−0.0338, 0.0368] | ✓ |
| Covariate-adjusted ownership estimate | −0.027 | −0.0270 | ✓ |
| Covariate-adjusted ownership SE | 0.005 | **0.0053** | ✓ (rounding) |
| Covariate-adjusted usage CI | [−0.002, 0.016] | [−0.0020, 0.0164] | ✓ |

**[MAJOR] Income baseline mean — Section 5.3**

> Text: "the jump in per-capita income is −S/47 on a **baseline mean of S/11,700**"

Table 1 shows the control-group (below-threshold) mean for `INGRESO_PC` = **S/11,416.51**, not S/11,700. The discrepancy is ~S/284 and is not explainable by rounding.

**[MAJOR] Population means — Section 3.3**

> Text: TIENE_BILLETERA "Population mean: 7.4%", USA_BILLETERA "Population mean: 15.6%"

Back-calculated from Table 1 (unweighted):
- TIENE_BILLETERA: (99667 × 0.0800 + 14088 × 0.0535) / 113755 ≈ **7.67%** (text says 7.4%)
- USA_BILLETERA: (99667 × 0.1794 + 14088 × 0.0319) / 113755 ≈ **16.1%** (text says 15.6%)

Both overstate how far the stated means are from what the table implies. The data-audit report confirms no survey weight column was found, so the discrepancy is unexplained.

---

### 2. Robustness Table — Two Critical Internal Contradictions

**[CRITICAL] Donut-hole specifications produce identical output (Table 3, Panel B)**

```
Donut 0.5:  −0.0014  SE=0.0213  CI=[−0.0388, 0.0449]  BW=10.65  N=19434
Donut 1.0:  −0.0014  SE=0.0213  CI=[−0.0388, 0.0449]  BW=10.65  N=19434
```

Every single number is identical across the two different exclusion windows. Excluding observations within ±0.5 versus ±1.0 year of the cutoff necessarily produces different samples (different N) and different bandwidth selections. This is a code-level duplication bug. The text cites these as separate results ("estimates of −0.001, removing the small negative point estimate entirely"); the robustness claim rests on a duplicated computation.

**[CRITICAL] Placebo cutoff — typographical error that misidentifies the specification**

> Text (Section 5.2): "Placebo cutoffs at age 53 (i.e., 12 years below the true cutoff) and **age 53** (12 years right)"

The right placebo cutoff is listed as age 53 twice. The parenthetical says "12 years right" of the true cutoff (65), which should be **age 77**, not age 53. This contradicts the description and misidentifies the specification.

**[MAJOR] Heterogeneity subgroup (POBREZA) is identical to baseline (Table 2)**

```
Baseline:         −0.0056  SE=0.0165  CI=[−0.0336, 0.0310]  BW=14.24  N=27809
het_POBREZA_low:  −0.0056  SE=0.0165  CI=[−0.0336, 0.0310]  BW=14.24  N=27809
```

A poverty-restricted subsample cannot have the same N (27,809) and bandwidth as the full sample. This is another apparent code bug where the poverty subgroup estimate was not actually computed.

---

### 3. McCrary Density Test — Missing p-value [MAJOR]

> Text: "The McCrary-style density test of Cattaneo et al. (2018) produces a test statistic of 2.0"

A test statistic of 2.0 in a two-sided density test corresponds to p ≈ 0.046 — borderline rejection of the no-manipulation null. The paper provides no p-value, simply asserting "no evidence of bunching specifically at age 65." The code review further notes the p-value extraction may be silently returning `nan` due to an API bug (`rd_den.p` vs. `rd_den.test['p_jk']`). The paper must either report the p-value explicitly or acknowledge that z = 2.0 is only marginally non-significant.

---

### 4. Figure Description — Impossible Age Reference [MAJOR]

> Text (Section 5.4): "rates rise from approximately 4% at age 50 to a maximum of 11% **near age 35** (younger adults), and decline monotonically with age"

An RDD plot centered at age 65 with bandwidth ~14 years shows roughly ages 51–79. Age 35 does not appear in this figure. The description is internally inconsistent: first it says rates "rise from 4% at age 50 to a maximum at age 35" (moving backward in age), then "decline monotonically with age" (moving forward). The RD figure caption makes no mention of age 35. This appears to be a residual from template text or from confusing the full-sample age distribution with the RDD window.

---

### 5. Missing Citation [CRITICAL]

> Text (Section 2.3): "The closest recent application to our setting... [CITATION MISSING — insert \citet{} key]"

A literal placeholder remains in the manuscript body. Not submittable.

---

### 6. Abstract vs. Body Consistency

| Claim | Abstract | Results Section | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ownership baseline CI | [−0.034, 0.031] | [−0.034, 0.031] | ✓ |
| Usage baseline CI | [−0.034, 0.037] | [−0.034, 0.037] | ✓ |
| Covariate-adjusted ownership | −0.027, SE=0.005 | −0.027, SE=0.005 | ✓ |
| Randomization p-value | 0.434 | 0.434 | ✓ |

Abstract-to-body consistency is otherwise good.

---

### 7. Citation / Bibliography Errors

**[MAJOR] Ardington et al. — wrong year in bibliography body**

```latex
\bibitem[Ardington et~al.2009]{ardington2016}
Ardington, C., Case, A., and Hosegood, V. (2016). ...
\textit{American Economic Journal: Applied Economics}, 8(1):22--48.
```

The actual Ardington, Case, and Hosegood paper (Labor Supply Responses to Large Social Transfers, South Africa) was published in **2009**, not 2016. The natbib label correctly says 2009 but the bibliography body says 2016 and AEJ:AE 8(1) — the correct citation is vol. 1(1):22–61 (2009). Year and volume/issue are both wrong in the body.

**[MAJOR] Banerjee et al. — label mismatch and content misapplication**

```latex
\bibitem[Banerjee et~al.2019]{banerjee2020}
Banerjee, A., Niehaus, P., and Suri, T. (2020). Universal Basic Income...
```

The natbib label says "2019" so in-text citations will render as "Banerjee et al.2019" — wrong year. More substantively, the paper is a global review of UBI, but the text cites it for the specific claim that "direct benefit transfers in Indonesia increase savings only when accompanied by financial-literacy components." This claim does not come from a UBI review article; it appears to conflate this citation with a different empirical study.

**[MAJOR] Deming and Noray — content mismatch**

```latex
\bibitem[Deming and Noray(2023)]{deming2023}
Deming, D.~J. and Noray, K. (2023). Earnings Dynamics, Changing Job Skills, and STEM Careers.
```

Cited in support of "the well-documented age gradient in technology adoption." The actual Deming-Noray paper is about STEM career earnings dynamics; it does not specifically document the age gradient in technology/digital adoption. The year listed (2023) also appears incorrect — this paper was published in the QJE in 2020. The citation is both misapplied and likely misdated.

---

### 8. Unexplained Bandwidth Jump [MINOR]

The baseline specification uses `rdrobust` with optimal BW = **14.24** (N = 27,809). The covariate-adjusted specification uses BW = **34.22** (N = 59,649) — more than double. This is not discussed anywhere in the empirical strategy or results. Readers cannot assess whether the covariate-adjusted estimate is driven by the larger bandwidth rather than the covariate adjustment itself.

---

### 9. Missing Education Observations — Undisclosed [MINOR]

Table 1 shows that `NIVEL_EDUCATIVO` has:
- Treated: N = 13,793 (295 missing out of 14,088)
- Control: N = 92,826 (6,841 missing out of 99,667)

6,841 missing education values in the control group (~6.9%) is non-trivial and is never acknowledged in the data section.

---

### 10. Template Artifact in Table 1 [MINOR]

The summary table renders four `---` columns labeled "---" in the header. This is a formatting artifact, not a substantive error, but it would be flagged by any journal typesetter.

---

## Consolidated Findings

| # | Severity | Issue |

| 15 | **MINOR** | ~6,841 missing education values in control group unacknowledged |

## 3. Unsupported Claims & Identification Integrity

## Claim Discipline Audit: Pensi\'on 65 RDD Paper

I'll work through the paper systematically, using the evidence packet to verify each claim against what the code actually produced.

---

### [CRITICAL-1] Donut-Hole Specifications Return Identical Results

**Where:** Section 5.2 / Table 3 Panel B

**Claim:** "Donut-hole specifications excluding observations within ±0.5 and ±1.0 years of the cutoff yield estimates of −0.001, removing the small negative point estimate entirely."

**Evidence:** Table 3 Panel B shows both donut specifications — 0.5 and 1.0 — returning **identical** values: Estimate=−0.0014, SE=0.0213, CI=[−0.0388, 0.0449], BW=10.65, N=19,434. A donut exclusion of ±0.5 vs. ±1.0 should drop different observations and produce different bandwidths, sample sizes, and estimates. The duplication is a near-certain sign of a coding error where the second donut-hole was not actually implemented. These robustness checks cannot be used as evidence.

---

### [CRITICAL-2] Placebo Test Has SE=0.0006 and N=99,667 — No Bandwidth Restriction Applied

**Where:** Section 5.2 / Table 3 Panel D

**Claim:** "The left placebo achieves a confidence interval that does not include zero, but the magnitude is similar to the actual cutoff estimate, reinforcing that the signal at age 65 is not specific to the program."

**Evidence:** Table 3 Panel D shows the first TIENE\_BILLETERA placebo row: Estimate=−0.0067, SE=0.0006, CI=[−0.0083, −0.0062], BW=7.41, N=99,667. A SE of 0.0006 with N=99,667 is consistent with an OLS regression run on the *entire* below-threshold sample with no bandwidth restriction — not a local RDD estimator centered on the placebo cutoff. A valid RDD placebo at age 53 should use observations within roughly [43, 63], not the full 99,667-person below-threshold sample. The result therefore reflects a global age-trend estimate, not an RDD discontinuity test. The fact that this "placebo" rejects the null is a design validity threat that the paper waves away with one sentence.

---

### [CRITICAL-3] Heterogeneity Subgroup `het_POBREZA_low` Returns Baseline Estimates

**Where:** Section 5.4 / Table 2

**Claim:** "Effects are uniformly small and statistically null across all subgroups."

**Evidence:** Table 2 row `het_POBREZA_low` shows Estimate=−0.0056, SE=(0.0165), CI=[−0.0336, 0.0310], N/BW=27,809/14.24 — **identical** to the full-sample baseline. Since the full sample has 113,755 individuals and N=27,809 is the within-bandwidth count for the full sample, the poverty subgroup filter was not applied. Claiming null heterogeneity by poverty status is unsupported when the subgroup estimate is numerically indistinguishable from the pooled estimate.

---

### [CRITICAL-4] Permutation p-value of 0.434 Is Irreconcilable With Reported t=−5.999

**Where:** Section 5.1 and 5.2

**Claim:** "Permutation-based randomization inference yields a t-statistic of −5.999 with a randomization p-value of 0.434. The conventional asymptotic test rejects the null at any standard level, but randomization inference...fails to reject."

**Analysis:** If the observed t-statistic is −5.999, then across 500 random permutations of treatment assignment in the age window [55, 75], finding a permuted t-statistic more extreme than −5.999 should occur essentially 0% of the time — not 43.4% of the time. A p-value of 0.434 with |t|=5.999 is self-contradictory unless the permutation test was applied to a **different specification** (almost certainly the baseline rdrobust, where t≈−0.34, and p≈0.434 would be perfectly sensible). The paper presents these numbers back-to-back under the covariate-adjusted discussion, implying they refer to the same specification. This conflation is either a reporting error or a coding error; either way, the claim that "randomization inference fails to reject" cannot be cited as independent evidence in the paper's current form.

---

### [CRITICAL-5] Missing Citation Left Verbatim in Published Text

**Where:** Section 2.3

**Verbatim:** "The closest recent application to our setting uses an age-65 cutoff for cash-transfer eligibility in a Latin American context and documents weak first-stage effects on digital savings [CITATION MISSING — insert \citet{} key]."

This is a placeholder that was never resolved. Beyond the obvious academic-integrity problem, the sentence it belongs to is being used to situate this paper in the literature and to establish the novelty of the contribution. Without knowing what paper is being cited, the reader cannot assess whether that paper already documents the main finding of this one.

---

### [MAJOR-1] The Estimand Is Labeled LATE But Is ITT

**Where:** Section 4.1, Equation (1)

**Claim:** "The estimand is the local average treatment effect (LATE) of crossing the eligibility threshold on each outcome."

**Problem:** In an RDD where treatment D_i = 1{age ≥ 65} represents *eligibility* and program receipt requires additionally being SISFOH-classified as extreme-poor, D_i is not the treatment of interest — it is an assignment mechanism. With ~25% non-take-up (acknowledged in Section 3.5), eligibility ≠ receipt. The correct label for the estimand under imperfect take-up is **intent-to-treat (ITT)**, not LATE. LATE in the IV sense would require using eligibility as an instrument for program receipt. The paper correctly calls this ITT everywhere except in the identification section, where the formula is misleadingly labeled LATE. This inconsistency will invite referee attention.

---

### [MAJOR-2] Covariate-Adjusted Specification Uses WLS With 2.4× Wider Bandwidth, Not rdrobust

**Where:** Section 4.2, Table 2

**Claim:** "We also estimate a covariate-adjusted specification... As discussed by \citet{calonico2019}, covariate adjustment in RDD reduces variance without affecting bias if covariates are continuous at the cutoff."

**Evidence:** Table 2 shows the covariate-adjusted method is `statsmodels_WLS` with BW=34.22 and N=59,649, versus `rdrobust` BW=14.24 and N=27,809 for the baseline. The bandwidth is 2.4 times wider and the estimator is WLS, not the local-polynomial estimator with covariates described in Calonico et al. (2019). The Calonico et al. (2019) result applies to covariates added *within* the rdrobust local-polynomial framework; it does not validate switching to a global WLS. The shift in estimate from −0.006 to −0.027 may partly reflect the wider bandwidth absorbing more of the secular age trend rather than variance reduction from covariates. The paper presents this as a refinement; it is a different estimator with different implicit assumptions.

### [MAJOR-3] "Causal Effect of Institutional Access" Overstates What ITT on Eligibility Delivers

**Where:** Section 1

**Verbatim:** "The age-65 eligibility threshold is administratively sharp; this provides a natural experiment for estimating the causal effect of institutional access on digital adoption among the elderly poor."

**Problem:** Three compounding attenuations separate the identified parameter from "institutional access":
1. ~25% of eligibles do not take up the program → ITT dilutes by non-take-up
2. Eligibility requires BOTH age ≥ 65 AND SISFOH extreme-poor status → the age-65 cutoff triggers eligibility for only a subset of age-65 crossers
3. The survey measures wallet ownership across the full general population, not just among program-eligible individuals

The identified effect is the effect of crossing age 65 on the full-population distribution of wallet ownership — not the effect of institutional access. Calling it the "causal effect of institutional access" is a mechanism claim that exceeds the design.

---

### [MAJOR-4] McCrary Density Test Statistic of 2.0 Is Borderline Significant; p-value Absent and Possibly Invalid

**Where:** Section 5.2

**Claim:** "The McCrary-style density test of \citet{cattaneo2018} produces a test statistic of 2.0; while the implementation flags mass-points at integer ages... there is no evidence of bunching specifically at age 65."

**Problems:**
- A z-statistic of 2.0 exceeds the conventional 5% critical value of 1.96. This is borderline rejection of no-manipulation, not clear non-rejection. Describing this as "no evidence" is too strong.
- The code review flags that `rd_den.p` may silently return `np.nan` due to an API mismatch with the rddensity Python package (the correct accessor may be `rd_den.test['p_jk']`). If the p-value is NaN, the paper has no valid density test at all.
- No p-value is reported anywhere in the paper — only the raw statistic.

---

### [MAJOR-5] Survey Weights Flagged as Missing; Population-Level Claims Unsupported

**Where:** Data Audit / Section 3.1 / Abstract

**Data Audit Warning:** "No survey weight column found. Results may not be population-representative."

**Paper Claim:** "Population-level inference is carried out with the official expansion factor (FACPOB07)... Population mean: 7.4%."

The data audit found no weight column in the cleaned data. If FACPOB07 was not actually applied during estimation, the "population mean" figures and the representation of estimates as nationally representative are incorrect. The unweighted mean for TIENE\_BILLETERA implied by the summary table is approximately 7.67% (weighted by cell size), not 7.4%, consistent with weights having some effect. The paper should explicitly confirm that weighted estimation was used and reconcile the data audit warning.

---

### [MAJOR-6] No Power Analysis for "Well-Powered Null" Claim

**Where:** Abstract, Section 1, Section 2.4

**Claim:** "The precisely estimated null... contributes substantively to a literature where well-powered nulls remain underrepresented."

**Problem:** The paper never presents a formal power analysis. The 95% CI for the baseline ownership estimate is [−0.034, 0.031] — a half-width of ~3.25 percentage points on a base rate of 7.4%. Whether this is "well-powered" depends on the minimum economically meaningful effect size, which is never defined. A 3pp change in a 7.4% base-rate outcome is arguably non-trivial (a 40% relative increase), meaning the design may lack power to detect economically important effects. The "well-powered null" framing requires a defensible effect-size benchmark.

---

### [MAJOR-7] Dual Eligibility Criterion Not Adequately Integrated Into ITT Interpretation

**Where:** Sections 3.5 and 6.1

**Claim:** "take-up of Pensi\'on 65 is incomplete (approximately 75% among the eligible). The intent-to-treat estimate dilutes whatever effect exists among actual recipients by the factor of non-take-up."

**Problem:** The dilution is two-stage, not one-stage:
1. Of all adults crossing age 65, only those classified as SISFOH extreme-poor are eligible at all (approximately 30% of age-65 adults per Section 3.5).
2. Of the ~30% who are eligible, approximately 75% actually take up.

So approximately 22.5% of all age-65 crossers are actual recipients. The paper discusses only the second stage of dilution, implying the ITT-to-LATE ratio is ~0.75 when it is closer to ~0.225. This substantially changes the implied effect on compliers under any policy interpretation.

---

### [MINOR-1] Placebo Cutoff Typo: Both Described as "Age 53"

**Where:** Section 5.2

**Verbatim:** "Placebo cutoffs at age 53 (i.e., 12 years below the true cutoff) and age 53 (12 years right)."

The right placebo should be at age 77. The typo is likely harmless, but it makes the description of Panel D ambiguous and the corresponding table entry uninterpretable without inference.

---

### [MINOR-2] Figure Description References Age 35 — Inconsistent With RDD Window

**Where:** Section 5.5

**Verbatim:** "rates rise from approximately 4% at age 50 to a maximum of 11% near age 35 (younger adults), and decline monotonically with age."

In the context of an age-65 RDD, the bandwidth window is approximately [51, 79]. Age 35 is outside this window and inconsistent with "declining monotonically with age" (if the peak is at 35, the series declines from 35 through 65, consistent — but a plot focused on [51,79] would not show this). The description is confusing and likely describes a global figure, not the local-linear RDD plot. If the figure shows ages 25–90, describing it accurately is fine, but the caption says "RDD Plot" — an RDD plot conventionally shows the local window.

---

### [MINOR-3] Citation Mismatch: Deming & Noray (2023) Cited for Age Gradient in Digital Adoption

**Where:** Section 5.1

**Claim:** "consistent with the well-documented age gradient in technology adoption \citep{deming2023}"

The Deming & Noray (2023) paper is titled *"Earnings Dynamics, Changing Job Skills, and STEM Careers"* and documents how returns to specific skills evolve over careers. It does not study digital wallet adoption, mobile money, or the age gradient in financial technology. This is likely a citation carried over from a template. The correct citation should reference literature on age gradients in mobile payment or digital financial service adoption (e.g., Suri 2017 or specific survey-based evidence from Peru or LATAM).

---

### [MINOR-4] "First" Contribution Claims Are Unverified

**Where:** Sections 1, 2.4, and 6

**Claim:** "the first regression-discontinuity evaluation of a major government transfer program's effect on digital financial behavior in Peru" / "the first sharply-identified evidence on Pensi\'on 65's effects on digital financial behavior using post-2023 microdata."

These are standard "first" claims that cannot be verified without a comprehensive literature search. Given the concurrent [CITATION MISSING] for what the paper acknowledges is "the closest recent application," the claim of novelty is particularly exposed.

---

### [MINOR-5] Minor Rounding Inconsistencies Between Text and Tables

**Where:** Sections 5.3 and abstract

| Location | Text says | Table shows |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract, ownership CI | [−0.034, 0.031] | [−0.0336, 0.0310] ✓ (rounds correctly) |
| Abstract, use CI | [−0.034, 0.037] | [−0.0338, 0.0368] ✓ |
| Sec 5.3, smartphone CI | [−0.015, 0.086] | [−0.0146, 0.0857] — text rounds to −0.015 but table is −0.0146 |
| Sec 5.3, income CI | [−2,079, 3,172] | [−2078.5952, 3171.9232] ✓ |

The smartphone CI lower bound rounding (−0.015 vs. −0.0146) is trivial but demonstrates less-than-careful transcription.

## 4. Mathematics, Equations & Notation

## Formal Review: Mathematical and Notational Content

---

### 1. Mathematical Correctness

**Equation (1) — LATE estimand** [CLEAN]
$$\tau = \lim_{a \downarrow 65} E[Y \mid A = a] - \lim_{a \uparrow 65} E[Y \mid A = a]$$
Standard sharp-RDD estimand. Direction of limits correct (right minus left).

**Equation (2) — Local linear** [CLEAN]
$$Y_i = \alpha + \tau D_i + \beta_1 (A_i - 65) + \beta_2 D_i (A_i - 65) + \varepsilon_i$$
Correct separate-slope local-linear form. The interaction $D_i(A_i-65)$ allows different slopes on each side — this is the textbook Hahn/Todd/Van der Klaauw specification.

**Covariate-adjusted CI check** [CLEAN]
Reported: estimate $-0.027$, SE $0.005$, CI $[-0.037, -0.017]$.
Implied CI: $-0.027 \pm 1.96 \times 0.005 = [-0.0368, -0.0172] \approx [-0.037, -0.017]$. ✓

**Bias-corrected CI for baseline** [CLEAN — but asymmetry must be flagged to reader]
Reported: estimate $-0.006$, robust SE $0.016$, CI $[-0.034, 0.031]$.
The midpoint of the CI is $(-0.034+0.031)/2 = -0.0015$, not $-0.006$. This is correct behaviour for rdrobust bias-corrected CIs (the CI is centred on the bias-corrected estimate, not the conventional one), but the paper never explains why the interval is not centred on the reported point estimate. This is an implicit source of reader confusion — [MINOR].

**Sample arithmetic** [CLEAN]
$117{,}721 - 3{,}966 = 113{,}755$. $3{,}966/117{,}721 = 3.37\% \approx 3.4\%$. $99{,}667 + 14{,}088 = 113{,}755$. ✓

---

### 2. [MAJOR] T-Statistic Inconsistent with Reported Estimate and SE

Section 5.1: *"Permutation-based randomization inference yields a t-statistic of $-5.999$."*

The covariate-adjusted estimate is $-0.027$ with SE $= 0.005$, giving $t = -0.027/0.005 = -5.4$, **not** $-5.999$. The discrepancy is ~10%. If the true (unrounded) estimate were $-0.030$ the t-stat would be $-6.0$, consistent with the displayed value but inconsistent with the rounded estimate $-0.027$.

The paper does not explain whether $-5.999$ is computed from a different specification, from the permutation procedure itself (which might use an alternative test statistic), or whether $-0.027$ is rounded from $-0.030$. As written, the three numbers ($\hat\tau = -0.027$, $\mathrm{SE}=0.005$, $t=-5.999$) are mutually inconsistent.

---

### 3. [MAJOR] Equation (3) Omits the D-Interaction on the Running-Variable Polynomial

Equation (2) correctly allows separate slopes:
$$\beta_1(A_i - 65) + \beta_2 D_i(A_i - 65)$$

Equation (3) collapses this to a single symmetric function:
$$g(A_i - 65)$$
with no $D_i$-interaction. Standard RDD covariate-adjustment (Calonico, Cattaneo, Farrell, Titiunik 2019, cited as `calonico2019`) **preserves** separate-slope (or separate-polynomial) fits on each side; the covariates $\mathbf{X}_i$ enter additively without altering the local polynomial structure. As written, Equation (3) implies a pooled regression on a single global polynomial — inconsistent with both Equation (2) and how `rdrobust` implements the covariate-adjusted estimator.

The correct representation should be:
$$Y_i = \alpha + \tau D_i + \beta_1(A_i-65) + \beta_2 D_i(A_i-65) + \mathbf{X}_i'\boldsymbol{\gamma} + \varepsilon_i$$
(or the analogous higher-order version), not a single $g(\cdot)$.

---

### 4. [MAJOR] Both Placebo Cutoffs Labeled "Age 53"

Section 5.2: *"Placebo cutoffs at age **53** (i.e., 12 years below the true cutoff) and age **53** (12 years right)..."*

Twelve years below 65 is age 53; twelve years above 65 is age **77**. The right-side placebo is erroneously printed as "age 53." This is an internal inconsistency: the text says "12 years right" but gives the same value as "12 years below." The estimates ($-0.007$ and $+0.008$) look plausible for two-sided placebos, so the computation is likely correct, but the description is definitively wrong.

---

### 5. [MAJOR] Explicitly Flagged Missing Citation

Section 2.3: *"[CITATION MISSING — insert \citet{} key]"*

The bracketed placeholder is in the submitted manuscript. No key is provided.

---

### 6. [MAJOR] Wrong Citation for Age–Technology Gradient Claim

Section 5.1 cites `\citet{deming2023}` for *"the well-documented age gradient in technology adoption."*

The listed reference for `deming2023` is:
> Deming, D.J. and Noray, K. (2023). Earnings Dynamics, Changing Job Skills, and STEM Careers. *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 135(4):1965–2005.

That paper studies STEM earnings and skill depreciation, **not** age differences in digital or technology adoption. The citation is incorrect for the stated claim.

---

### 7. [MINOR] Cohen's d Computation Not Reconcilable with Reported Inputs

Section 5.1: *"The Cohen's $d$ effect size for the primary outcome is $-0.021$."*

For a binary outcome with population mean $p = 0.074$, the standard deviation is $\sqrt{0.074 \times 0.926} \approx 0.262$. Using the baseline estimate: $d = -0.006/0.262 \approx -0.023$. Using the covariate-adjusted estimate: $d = -0.027/0.262 \approx -0.103$. Neither matches $-0.021$. The paper does not state which estimate or which SD was used. The value $-0.021$ would require a denominator of $\approx 0.286$, plausible only for a different subsample or a pooled-SD formula. Source of computation should be disclosed.

---

### 8. [MINOR] Figure Description Contains Reversed Age Direction

Section 5.5: *"rates rise from approximately 4\% at age 50 to a maximum of 11\% near age 35 (younger adults)"*

Rates do not "rise from age 50 to age 35" — that traverses the age axis backwards. The correct description is that ownership declines from ~11% at age 35 to ~4% at age 50 as age increases. As written, the direction-of-change language is inverted.

---

### 9. [MINOR] Potential Outcomes $Y(0), Y(1)$ Not Formally Introduced

Assumption 1 in Section 4.1 references $E[Y(0)\mid A=a]$ and $E[Y(1)\mid A=a]$ without prior definition of the potential-outcome notation. $Y$ is defined in the introduction only as "the outcome of interest." A one-line formal introduction of the Rubin-causal notation before Assumption 1 is needed.

---

### 10. [MINOR] Ardington Bibitem Year Tag Contradicts Body Year

```latex
\bibitem[Ardington et~al.2009]{ardington2016}
Ardington, C., Case, A., and Hosegood, V. (2016). ...
```

The display tag says `2009`; the body year is `(2016)`. The actual Ardington–Case–Hosegood paper appeared in *AEJ: Applied Economics* **1**(1), 2009 (not volume 8, 2016). Both the year in the display tag and the volume/year in the body are inconsistent with each other and with the actual publication. The label `ardington2016` is also inconsistent with a 2009 publication.

---

### 11. [MINOR] Indicator Function Font

`\mathbf{1}\{A_i \ge 65\}` uses **bold upright** for the indicator. The standard in econometrics papers is `\mathbb{1}` (blackboard bold) or `\mathbf{1}_{[\cdot]}`. Minor cosmetic issue.

## 5. Tables, Figures & Documentation

I have all the table content needed from the prompt. Proceeding with the full review now.

---

# Journal Production Editor Review: Tables & Figures

---

## TABLE 1 — Summary Statistics by Treatment Status

### [CRITICAL] Nested `\begin{table}` float environment
`table_1_summary.tex` opens its own `\begin{table}[htbp]...\end{table}` environment. Main.tex wraps the `\input{}` call in *another* `\begin{table}[H]...\end{table}`. LaTeX forbids nested float environments; this **will not compile**.

### [CRITICAL] `tablenotes` outside `threeparttable`
The file uses `\begin{tablenotes}` (a `threeparttable` environment) but the table is not wrapped in `\begin{threeparttable}`. The notes will not render or will throw errors.

### [CRITICAL] Duplicate `\caption{}` and `\label{tab:summary}`
The .tex file contains `\caption{Summary Statistics by Treatment Status}` and `\label{tab:summary}`. Main.tex adds `\caption{Summary Statistics by Age-65 Cutoff}` and its own `\label{tab:summary}`. Two captions will appear in the PDF and LaTeX will warn "multiply-defined label."

### [MAJOR] Caption text mismatch
- `.tex` file: *"Summary Statistics by Treatment Status"*
- `main.tex`: *"Summary Statistics by Age-65 Cutoff"*

These must agree. The main.tex version is more informative.

### [MAJOR] Meaningless "---" columns
Each treatment group carries a 4th column uniformly showing `---`, labeled `---` in the header. The tablenotes explain this as "unavailable data." Publishing four blank columns wastes space and confuses readers. Either supply the intended statistic (Min, Max, p-value for mean difference?) or remove these columns entirely.

### [MAJOR] Raw variable-name labels throughout
All row labels are source-code identifiers (`TIENE_BILLETERA`, `USA_BILLETERA`, `INTERNET_HOGAR`, `SMARTPHONE`, `POBREZA`, `INGRESO_PC`, `NIVEL_EDUCATIVO`). A published table requires human-readable labels, e.g.:

| Code name | Readable label |
|---|---|
| `TIENE_BILLETERA` | Digital Wallet Ownership (=1) |
| `USA_BILLETERA` | Active Wallet Use (=1) |
| `INTERNET_HOGAR` | Household Internet Access (=1) |
| `SMARTPHONE` | Household Owns Smartphone (=1) |
| `POBREZA` | Poverty Category (1=extreme, 3=non-poor) |
| `INGRESO_PC` | Per-Capita Income (S/) |
| `NIVEL_EDUCATIVO` | Education Level |

### [MINOR] Notes do not define variables
Notes explain the treatment/control split but do not define what any variable measures. A self-contained table must include variable definitions.

### [MINOR] No weighted-mean column
ENAHO analysis uses expansion factors (`FACPOB07`). Unweighted means may differ substantially from population means cited in text (7.4% for `TIENE_BILLETERA`, 15.6% for `USA_BILLETERA`). Notes should clarify whether these are unweighted or weighted statistics.

---

## TABLE 2 — Main RDD Results

> **Note:** The supplied source was truncated after the `het_SMARTPHONE_low` panel. Issues below reflect what was visible.

### [CRITICAL] Nested `\begin{table}` float environment
Same structural defect as Table 1 — will prevent compilation.

### [CRITICAL] Code bug — `het_POBREZA_low` is an exact copy of baseline
`het_POBREZA_low` and the baseline row share **identical** estimates, SEs, CIs, N, and BW:

| | Estimate | SE | CI | N/BW |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | −0.0056 | 0.0165 | [−0.0336, 0.0310] | 27809 / 14.24 |
| het_POBREZA_low | −0.0056 | 0.0165 | [−0.0336, 0.0310] | 27809 / 14.24 |

This is almost certainly a code bug where the poverty-status subsetting filter was not applied. The text (Section 5.4) describes non-zero heterogeneity across subgroups, so the table's uniformity is inconsistent with the prose.

### [MAJOR] Caption and label mismatch
- `.tex` file: `\caption{Main RDD Estimates}` / `\label{tab:main_results}`
- `main.tex`: `\caption{Main RDD Results: Effect of Crossing Age 65 on Digital Wallet Outcomes}` / `\label{tab:main}`

The outer `\label{tab:main}` is what `\ref{tab:main}` resolves to; the inner label `tab:main_results` is orphaned.

### [MAJOR] Column headers are raw code names
`TIENE_BILLETERA` and `USA_BILLETERA` must be replaced with descriptive headers, e.g., "(1) Digital Wallet Ownership" and "(2) Active Wallet Use." Best practice also adds a brief note "(binary outcome)" or units.

### [MAJOR] Panel labels are raw code identifiers
`\textit{baseline}`, `\textit{with_covariates}`, `\textit{extended_covariates}`, `\textit{het_POBREZA_low}`, etc. are code-pipeline tags, not reader-facing labels. Correct labels:

| Code | Readable |
|---|---|
| `baseline` | A. Baseline (Local Linear, no covariates) |
| `with_covariates` | B. With Predetermined Covariates |
| `extended_covariates` | C. Extended Covariate Set |
| `het_POBREZA_low` | D. Heterogeneity: Extreme-Poor Subsample |
| `het_INTERNET_HOGAR_low` | E. Heterogeneity: No Household Internet |
| `het_INTERNET_HOGAR_high` | F. Heterogeneity: Household Internet Present |
| `het_SMARTPHONE_low` | G. Heterogeneity: No Smartphone |

### [MAJOR] "Method" row shows implementation library names
`rdrobust` and `statsmodels_WLS` are software package names, not econometric method descriptions. Replace with "Local linear RD (triangular kernel)" and "WLS with polynomial controls," respectively. Notes should clarify estimators.

### [MAJOR] Text–table CI discrepancy for covariate-adjusted ownership
Section 5.1: CI reported as `[−0.037, −0.017]`; table shows `[−0.0373, −0.0167]`. At 3-decimal rounding −0.0373 → −0.037 ✓, −0.0167 → −0.017 ✓ — marginally acceptable, but the abstract and Section 4.1 headline round to two decimal places (`[−0.034, 0.031]`) for the baseline, creating inconsistent precision across the paper.

### [MAJOR] Suspicious permutation inference reporting (Section 5.1)
Text states: *"randomization inference yields a t-statistic of −5.999 with a randomization p-value of 0.434."* A t-statistic of |6.0| is extreme under any standard distribution; paired with a 43% randomization p-value, these numbers are inconsistent and require explanation or correction. Either the t-statistic is from the covariate-adjusted WLS model (where −0.027/0.0053 ≈ −5.1, not −6.0) or the permutation procedure was applied to a wrong specification.

### [MINOR] Notes (likely present but not visible in truncated content)
Cannot confirm whether notes define bandwidth selection method, inference procedure, or significance stars. This must be verified in the full file.

## TABLE 3 — Robustness Checks

### [CRITICAL] Nested `\begin{table}` float environment
Same structural defect — will not compile.

### [CRITICAL] `tablenotes` outside `threeparttable`
Same defect as Table 1.

### [CRITICAL] Code bug — donut-hole 0.5 and 1.0 are identical
Panel B rows for donut 0.5 and donut 1.0 show **identical** estimates, SEs, CIs, BW, and N:

```
0.5   -0.0014  0.0213  [-0.0388, 0.0449]  10.65  19434
1.0   -0.0014  0.0213  [-0.0388, 0.0449]  10.65  19434
```

Excluding ±0.5 and ±1.0 years from the cutoff necessarily produces different samples and different bandwidths. Identical results indicate a copy-paste error or code bug. **This cannot be published as-is.**

### [MAJOR] Column count mismatch
The tabular spec is `{l cccccc}` = 7 columns, but the header row supplies only 6 entries (`Test & Estimate & SE & 95\% CI & BW & N`). This is a silent alignment error; LaTeX will not throw an error but will pad an empty column, misaligning all cells.

### [MAJOR] Panel D — two "TIENE_BILLETERA" rows with no distinguishing label
Both placebo-cutoff rows are labeled "TIENE_BILLETERA" with no indication of which age is used as the placebo. The text (Section 5.2) says "Placebo cutoffs at age 53 (12 years below the true cutoff) and **age 53** (12 years right)" — the second occurrence of "age 53" is a **typo**; it should be age 77 (65 + 12). The table rows must be labeled, e.g., "Placebo cutoff: age 53" and "Placebo cutoff: age 77."

### [MAJOR] Text–table conflict on placebo CI
Section 5.2: *"The left placebo achieves a confidence interval that does not include zero."* Table shows CI `[−0.0083, −0.0062]` with SE `= 0.0006` — an implausibly tight standard error (~6× smaller than the primary outcome SE). This merits verification.

### [MAJOR] Panel D mixes outcome-placebo and cutoff-placebo tests
`INTERNET_HOGAR` and `SMARTPHONE` rows appear to test covariate discontinuities — the same test already performed in Table 4 (Balance). Including them again in Panel D under "Placebo" without labeling the distinction (covariate outcome vs. placebo cutoff) creates confusion and apparent duplication.

### [MAJOR] "H Double" bandwidth CI is inconsistent
Panel A row "H Double": Estimate −0.0204, CI `[−0.0272, 0.0264]`. The CI width is 0.053 at BW = 28.48. But the CI is not symmetric around the estimate: −0.0204 − (−0.0272) = 0.0068 on the left vs. 0.0264 − (−0.0204) = 0.0468 on the right. This asymmetry is expected with bias-corrected robust CIs, but the text (Section 5.2) says "all 95% confidence intervals overlapping zero" — this CI does overlap zero (lower bound −0.0272, upper bound +0.0264), so the statement is accurate, but readers should be told the CI is bias-corrected.

### [MINOR] Panel A labels
"H Half", "H Optimal", "H Double" should be expanded: e.g., "h*/2 = 7.12", "h* = 14.24 (MSE-optimal)", "2h* = 28.48" — the actual bandwidth values are already in the BW column so abbreviations are ambiguous without footnotes.

---

## TABLE 4 — Covariate Balance

### [CRITICAL] Nested `\begin{table}` float environment
Same structural defect.

### [MAJOR] Caption and label mismatch
- `.tex` file: `\caption{Covariate Balance at the Age-65 Eligibility Threshold (Within Bandwidth)}` / `\label{tab:cov_balance}`
- `main.tex`: `\caption{Covariate Balance at Age-65 Cutoff (RDD Estimates)}` / `\label{tab:balance}`

The `\ref{tab:balance}` in main.tex resolves to the outer float's label (correct), but the inner `tab:cov_balance` is orphaned and inconsistent.

### [MINOR] Asterisk notation defined but unused
Notes define `$^{*}$ 95% CI excludes zero` but no asterisks appear in the table body. Either add markers where warranted or remove the footnote symbol.

### [MINOR] Raw variable names
Same issue as Tables 1–2: `INTERNET_HOGAR`, `SMARTPHONE`, `POBREZA`, `INGRESO_PC`, `NIVEL_EDUCATIVO` should be human-readable labels.

### [MINOR] Text–table consistency
All three specific values called out in Section 5.3 cross-check correctly against Table 4 (±0.001 rounding tolerance). ✓

## FIGURES

### Figure 1 — RD Plot (`figure_1_rdplot.png`)

**Caption:** *"RDD Plot: Digital Wallet Ownership by Age. Binned scatter with local-linear fit on each side of the cutoff. The vertical line marks age 65. There is no visible discontinuity at the cutoff."*

**[MINOR]** Caption editorializes. "There is no visible discontinuity at the cutoff" is a conclusion, not a description. Move to body text.

**[MINOR]** No axis label information. Caption should state explicitly: X-axis = age in years; Y-axis = share of respondents owning a digital wallet (%).

**[MINOR]** Caption does not state whether confidence bands are displayed. Standard RD plots show 95% CI shading on the fit lines; if present, they must be mentioned.

**[MINOR]** Section 5.5 prose error: *"rates rise from approximately 4% at age 50 to a maximum of 11% near age 35."* This sentence describes age decreasing (50 → 35), which is backwards. Should read: *"rates decline from approximately 11% near age 35 to about 4% at age 50."*

### Figure 2 — Bandwidth Sensitivity (`figure_2_bandwidth_sensitivity.png`)

**Caption:** *"Bandwidth Sensitivity. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome (TIENE_BILLETERA) across bandwidth choices ranging from h*/2 to 2h*. The estimates are stable and confidence intervals consistently cover zero."*

**[MINOR]** Caption editorializes ("estimates are stable…"). Move to text.

**[MINOR]** `TIENE_BILLETERA` in caption should be replaced with "digital wallet ownership."

**[MINOR]** Axis labels absent from caption. Should specify: X-axis = bandwidth (years); Y-axis = RD estimate (percentage points).

**[MINOR]** Caption does not indicate whether the bandwidth axis is discrete or continuous, or how many points are shown.

### Figure 3 — McCrary Density (`figure_mccrary_density.png`)

**Caption:** *"Density of the Running Variable around the Age-65 Cutoff. The histogram displays the empirical density of age in the sample. While integer-age mass points are visible (a feature of self-reported age in years), there is no evidence of bunching specifically at age 65."*

**[MINOR]** Caption editorializes ("there is no evidence of bunching"). Move to text.

**[MINOR]** Y-axis label absent: does the y-axis show counts, frequency, or estimated density?

**[MINOR]** Test statistic and p-value (t = 2.0) are reported in the text (Section 5.2) but not in the caption or figure note. Self-contained figures should include these.

## ADDITIONAL CROSS-PAPER ISSUES

### [CRITICAL] Unresolved citation placeholder — Section 2.3
*"[CITATION MISSING — insert \citet{} key]"* appears verbatim in the literature review. This will be visible in the compiled PDF.

### [MAJOR] Bibliographic year inconsistencies in `thebibliography`
- `\bibitem[Ardington et~al.2009]{ardington2016}`: Author-date label says **2009** but the cited article is *AEJ: Applied Economics* **8(1):22–48, 2016**. The label prefix must match the publication year.
- `\bibitem[Banerjee et~al.2019]{banerjee2020}`: Label says **2019** but the *Annual Review of Economics* paper is listed as **2020** everywhere else. These inconsistencies affect `natbib`'s author-year rendering.

### [MAJOR] Text cites `\citet{deming2023}` for "age gradient in technology adoption"
The actual Deming & Noray (2023) paper studies *earnings dynamics and STEM careers* — not technology adoption by elderly populations. This appears to be a misattributed citation.

## 6. Contribution Evaluation

## Referee Report

**Journal:** Top-Field Economics
**Paper:** "Does Crossing the Pensión 65 Eligibility Threshold Increase Digital Wallet Adoption? A Regression Discontinuity Analysis with ENAHO 2024"

---

### Part 1 — Central Contribution

The paper estimates a sharp RDD at Peru's age-65 Pensión 65 eligibility threshold using the first nationally representative microdata (ENAHO 2024) to separately identify digital wallet ownership and use, finding a precisely estimated null ITT effect and contributing credible evidence that institutional digitization of transfers does not, on its own, overcome the age gradient in digital financial adoption.

**Rating: Incremental** — the Peru-specific application is novel and the use of ENAHO 2024 is timely, but the contribution is primarily an addition to an existing null-results literature rather than a new theoretical or empirical advance.

---

### Part 2 — Identification and Credibility

**Variation used:** Discontinuity in Pensión 65 eligibility at age 65. The running variable (completed years of age) is straightforward, and the administrative cutoff is sharp in the sense that no one below 65 can qualify on age grounds.

**Plausible exogeneity:** Broadly credible. Age is not manipulable with precision, the McCrary test shows no bunching at 65, and the paper tests covariate continuity. The identification strategy is standard and well-applied.

**Main threats:**

1. **Eligibility is jointly determined by age AND SISFOH extreme-poor status.** This is the design's most serious unaddressed weakness. The RDD is estimated on the full population of 113,755 individuals, but the program only affects those who are *both* aged 65+ and SISFOH-classified extreme-poor. For the roughly 70% of 65+ individuals who are *not* extreme-poor, crossing the age threshold generates zero first-stage variation. The ITT estimate on the full sample is therefore a diluted mixture of a real program effect (for the eligible poor) and a zero effect (for everyone else). The paper acknowledges incomplete take-up but never quantifies the dilution or presents the analysis restricted to the relevant subpopulation. This is not a fatal flaw — the ITT on the full population is a defensible estimand — but the paper needs to directly address what we learn from it, and whether a subsample estimate for extreme-poor households is feasible with available SISFOH proxies (the POBREZA variable is available in the data).

2. **Missing first-stage evidence.** The paper reports that ~30% of those aged 65+ participate in Pensión 65 and ~25% of eligibles do not take up. There is no table or figure showing the first-stage discontinuity: does crossing age 65 actually increase Pensión 65 benefit receipt in the ENAHO data? Without this, the reader cannot distinguish between two very different stories: (a) the program reaches people but has no effect on digital adoption, or (b) the program barely reaches anyone near the cutoff and the null simply reflects a weak instrument. The first-stage is essential framing even in an ITT design.

3. **Other age-65 discontinuities.** Peru has additional programs and age-based changes that activate at or near 65 (labor market exit, social security rules, EsSalud age thresholds). The paper briefly acknowledges this in the ITT framing but does not attempt to enumerate or bound the contaminating effects.

**Design verdict:** The core identification is credible, but the dilution problem and absent first-stage prevent the paper from claiming it has estimated the effect of Pensión 65's digital onboarding mechanism specifically.

---

### Part 3 — Required and Suggested Analyses

#### Required [CRITICAL]

**[CRITICAL-1] First-stage table.** Show the discontinuity in Pensión 65 receipt (or any Banco de la Nación/Cuenta DNI account ownership) at age 65. This does not need to be formal LATE scaling — even a descriptive figure showing uptake by single-year age bin with a vertical line at 65 would establish that the institutional mechanism the paper hypothesizes actually turns on at the cutoff. Without this, the null is uninterpretable.

**[CRITICAL-2] Subsample analysis for the extreme-poor.** Restrict the sample to individuals in POBREZA = 1 (extreme poor) or use an interaction specification that isolates the effect for the SISFOH-eligible subgroup. The full-population ITT is a valid estimand, but a referee at a top-field journal will ask: "among those for whom crossing age 65 actually matters, what happens?" If the subsample is too small for the rdrobust procedure, acknowledge this explicitly and report whatever precision is available; power limitations are a legitimate finding.

**[CRITICAL-3] Clarify the ITT vs. LATE labeling.** Equation (1) and the surrounding text call τ the "local average treatment effect (LATE)," but Section 3.4 correctly characterizes the design as ITT. These are different estimands. The LATE in an RDD with incomplete take-up is τ divided by the first-stage jump. Use consistent terminology throughout, and explain in the text what the ITT estimate represents quantitatively relative to the potential LATE.

#### Suggested [MAJOR]

**[MAJOR-1] Explain the covariate-adjusted point-estimate shift.** The baseline estimate for ownership is −0.006 (SE = 0.016); the covariate-adjusted estimate is −0.027 (SE = 0.005). In a valid sharp RDD, adding balanced covariates should reduce variance without substantially changing the point estimate. A shift from −0.006 to −0.027 — roughly 4× the standard error of the adjusted estimate — is not a minor refinement; it signals either (a) covariates are not balanced locally despite the global balance test, (b) the bandwidth changes between specifications, or (c) the model is absorbing variation that is correlated with treatment status in a way that affects identification. The paper attributes this to the "secular age gradient," but this logic is circular: if the age gradient is continuous at the cutoff (as assumed), it should not shift the discontinuity estimate. The authors should report whether the bandwidth is identical across both specifications, and provide an F-test or joint significance test for covariate balance *within the bandwidth window*.

**[MAJOR-2] Explain the t-statistic vs. randomization p discrepancy.** The paper reports a conventional t-statistic of −5.999 alongside a randomization p-value of 0.434, and attributes the discrepancy to the discrete running variable. A t-statistic of −6 is extraordinary; even under discrete-age mass-points, this magnitude demands explanation. Is the t-statistic computed from the cluster-robust SEs, the nearest-neighbor SEs, or something else? What is the size of the permutation distribution — does it look symmetric? A figure of the permutation distribution with the observed statistic marked would immediately resolve the concern.

**[MAJOR-3] Use survey weights.** The data audit flags that population-level inference is conducted without survey weights despite the official ENAHO expansion factor (FACPOB07) being available in the cleaned data. For descriptive statistics (Table 1), this matters: the paper reports a 7.4% population mean for wallet ownership, but without weights this is the unweighted sample mean, which overstates rural and small-department representation. For the RDD estimates, the impact is smaller near the cutoff (where sampling variation should not correlate sharply with the design), but the paper's claims about "nationally representative" inference are weakened. At minimum, show weighted and unweighted descriptive means side by side.

**[MAJOR-4] Remove template artifacts.** The code review confirms that three output items still contain electoral RDD boilerplate: Table 1 note references "municipality-elections where the party's vote share exceeded the electoral threshold," Table 4 header reads "at the Electoral Threshold," and Figure 1 x-axis is labeled "Vote Margin." These must be corrected before any submission. A paper this careful about statistical methodology should not reach a referee with these artifacts.

**[MAJOR-5] Fill the missing citation.** Section 2.3 contains a plainly visible "[CITATION MISSING — insert \citet{} key]." This should not appear in a submitted manuscript.

---

### Part 4 — Literature Positioning

The paper cites the right papers (Bachas et al. 2018, Muralidharan & Niehaus 2016, Banerjee et al. 2020 on transfer digitization; Card et al. 2008, Battistin et al. 2009 on age-threshold RDDs; Cattaneo et al. 2018, Calonico et al. 2014/2019 on RDD methodology). The framing of the null as consistent with dormant-account literature is appropriate and the paper correctly identifies its contribution relative to M-Pesa/mobile money literature.

Two gaps: First, the Peru-specific literature is thin. The BCRP 2024 report is cited descriptively, but there is essentially no engagement with prior work on Yape/Plin adoption, Cuenta DNI rollout, or the broader Peruvian fintech ecosystem beyond that single citation. Second, the literature on *heterogeneous effects of digital transfer programs by age* is undercited — the paper's main finding is that the age gradient dominates any program effect, and this deserves richer grounding in the behavioral literature on technology adoption by older adults (e.g., Czaja et al., Liang et al.) rather than the single \citet{deming2023} citation.

The [CITATION MISSING] placeholder in Section 2.3 is the only truly disqualifying presentation error: it signals the paper was not ready for external review.

---

### Part 5 — Journal Fit and Recommendation

The paper addresses a relevant policy question, uses a credible design on a large nationally representative dataset, and applies a thorough robustness battery. The null result is honestly framed and the confidence intervals are reasonably tight. For a top-field journal, however, the absent first-stage is a genuine obstacle — referees will ask for it and its absence means the paper's core interpretive claim (that the program's institutional channel fails to change digital behavior) cannot be distinguished from the claim that the program simply isn't reaching anyone near the threshold. The subsample analysis and ITT/LATE clarification are similarly necessary before this paper can be evaluated on its merits.

**Recommendation: Revise before sending**

The paper is not a desk reject — the design is credible, the data contribution is real, and the robustness work is thorough. But the three required analyses above need to be in the paper before sending to referees. With those in place, this is a solid submission to a field journal (EDCC, JDE, JHE, World Bank Economic Review) and a competitive — though not certain — submission to a top general field journal.

---

### Part 6 — Questions to the Authors

1. **First stage:** Can you show the RDD estimate for Pensión 65 benefit receipt (or any Banco de la Nación account) at age 65 in the ENAHO data? If the program measure is not in ENAHO, what administrative data could be used to validate that the institutional mechanism activates at the cutoff?

2. **SISFOH dilution:** Among individuals in the POBREZA = 1 (extreme poor) cell — the group for whom crossing age 65 actually confers eligibility — what are the RDD estimates for wallet ownership and use? If the sample is underpowered, what is the minimum detectable effect for that subsample?

3. **Covariate-adjusted shift:** Is the bandwidth identical in the unadjusted (−0.006) and covariate-adjusted (−0.027) specifications? If so, can you show a joint F-test for covariate balance within the bandwidth window and explain the mechanism by which balanced covariates shift the point estimate by this magnitude?

4. **t-statistic discrepancy:** Please show the permutation distribution for the primary outcome and clarify which standard error (cluster-robust, nearest-neighbor, or other) yields the t-statistic of −5.999. The conventional and randomization-based inference should be reconciled rather than treated as parallel evidence.

5. **Other age-65 discontinuities:** What other programs or policy changes activate at age 65 in Peru? Have you tested for discontinuities in labor market participation, EsSalud enrollment, or other outcomes at age 65 that could confound the wallet adoption estimate?

6. **Survey weights:** Why were ENAHO expansion factors excluded from the RDD estimates and descriptive statistics? Please show both weighted and unweighted means for the main outcomes and discuss whether the optimal bandwidth changes under weighted estimation.

7. **Mechanism:** Given the null result, can you use ENAHO data to characterize the intensive margin — for those who *do* receive Pensión 65, is there any evidence that wallet ownership or use is higher than for non-recipients of the same age and poverty status? An OLS comparison (with obvious caveats about selection) would sharpen the policy interpretation.
