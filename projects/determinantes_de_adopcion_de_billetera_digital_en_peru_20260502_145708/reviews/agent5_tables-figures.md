# Journal Production Editor Review: Tables & Figures

---

## TABLE 1 — Summary Statistics by Treatment Status

### [CRITICAL] Nested `\begin{table}` float environment
`table_1_summary.tex` opens its own `\begin{table}[htbp]...\end{table}` environment. Main.tex wraps the `\input{}` call in *another* `\begin{table}[H]...\end{table}`. LaTeX forbids nested float environments; this **will not compile**.

### [CRITICAL] `tablenotes` outside `threeparttable`
The file uses `\begin{tablenotes}` (a `threeparttable` environment) but the table is not wrapped in `\begin{threeparttable}`. The notes will not render or will throw errors.

### [CRITICAL] Duplicate `\caption{}` and `\label{tab:summary}`
The .tex file contains `\caption{Summary Statistics by Treatment Status}` and `\label{tab:summary}`. Main.tex adds `\caption{Summary Statistics by Age-65 Cutoff}` and its own `\label{tab:summary}`. Two captions will appear in the PDF and LaTeX will warn "multiply-defined label."

### [MAJOR] Caption text mismatch
- `.tex` file: *"Summary Statistics by Treatment Status"*
- `main.tex`: *"Summary Statistics by Age-65 Cutoff"*

These must agree. The main.tex version is more informative.

### [MAJOR] Meaningless "---" columns
Each treatment group carries a 4th column uniformly showing `---`, labeled `---` in the header. The tablenotes explain this as "unavailable data." Publishing four blank columns wastes space and confuses readers. Either supply the intended statistic (Min, Max, p-value for mean difference?) or remove these columns entirely.

### [MAJOR] Raw variable-name labels throughout
All row labels are source-code identifiers (`TIENE_BILLETERA`, `USA_BILLETERA`, `INTERNET_HOGAR`, `SMARTPHONE`, `POBREZA`, `INGRESO_PC`, `NIVEL_EDUCATIVO`). A published table requires human-readable labels, e.g.:

| Code name | Readable label |
|---|---|
| `TIENE_BILLETERA` | Digital Wallet Ownership (=1) |
| `USA_BILLETERA` | Active Wallet Use (=1) |
| `INTERNET_HOGAR` | Household Internet Access (=1) |
| `SMARTPHONE` | Household Owns Smartphone (=1) |
| `POBREZA` | Poverty Category (1=extreme, 3=non-poor) |
| `INGRESO_PC` | Per-Capita Income (S/) |
| `NIVEL_EDUCATIVO` | Education Level |

### [MINOR] Notes do not define variables
Notes explain the treatment/control split but do not define what any variable measures. A self-contained table must include variable definitions.

### [MINOR] No weighted-mean column
ENAHO analysis uses expansion factors (`FACPOB07`). Unweighted means may differ substantially from population means cited in text (7.4% for `TIENE_BILLETERA`, 15.6% for `USA_BILLETERA`). Notes should clarify whether these are unweighted or weighted statistics.

## TABLE 2 — Main RDD Results

> **Note:** The supplied source was truncated after the `het_SMARTPHONE_low` panel. Issues below reflect what was visible.

### [CRITICAL] Nested `\begin{table}` float environment
Same structural defect as Table 1 — will prevent compilation.

### [CRITICAL] Code bug — `het_POBREZA_low` is an exact copy of baseline
`het_POBREZA_low` and the baseline row share **identical** estimates, SEs, CIs, N, and BW:

| | Estimate | SE | CI | N/BW |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | −0.0056 | 0.0165 | [−0.0336, 0.0310] | 27809 / 14.24 |
| het_POBREZA_low | −0.0056 | 0.0165 | [−0.0336, 0.0310] | 27809 / 14.24 |

This is almost certainly a code bug where the poverty-status subsetting filter was not applied. The text (Section 5.4) describes non-zero heterogeneity across subgroups, so the table's uniformity is inconsistent with the prose.

### [MAJOR] Caption and label mismatch
- `.tex` file: `\caption{Main RDD Estimates}` / `\label{tab:main_results}`
- `main.tex`: `\caption{Main RDD Results: Effect of Crossing Age 65 on Digital Wallet Outcomes}` / `\label{tab:main}`

The outer `\label{tab:main}` is what `\ref{tab:main}` resolves to; the inner label `tab:main_results` is orphaned.

### [MAJOR] Column headers are raw code names
`TIENE_BILLETERA` and `USA_BILLETERA` must be replaced with descriptive headers, e.g., "(1) Digital Wallet Ownership" and "(2) Active Wallet Use." Best practice also adds a brief note "(binary outcome)" or units.

### [MAJOR] Panel labels are raw code identifiers
`\textit{baseline}`, `\textit{with_covariates}`, `\textit{extended_covariates}`, `\textit{het_POBREZA_low}`, etc. are code-pipeline tags, not reader-facing labels. Correct labels:

| Code | Readable |
|---|---|
| `baseline` | A. Baseline (Local Linear, no covariates) |
| `with_covariates` | B. With Predetermined Covariates |
| `extended_covariates` | C. Extended Covariate Set |
| `het_POBREZA_low` | D. Heterogeneity: Extreme-Poor Subsample |
| `het_INTERNET_HOGAR_low` | E. Heterogeneity: No Household Internet |
| `het_INTERNET_HOGAR_high` | F. Heterogeneity: Household Internet Present |
| `het_SMARTPHONE_low` | G. Heterogeneity: No Smartphone |

### [MAJOR] "Method" row shows implementation library names
`rdrobust` and `statsmodels_WLS` are software package names, not econometric method descriptions. Replace with "Local linear RD (triangular kernel)" and "WLS with polynomial controls," respectively. Notes should clarify estimators.

### [MAJOR] Text–table CI discrepancy for covariate-adjusted ownership
Section 5.1: CI reported as `[−0.037, −0.017]`; table shows `[−0.0373, −0.0167]`. At 3-decimal rounding −0.0373 → −0.037 ✓, −0.0167 → −0.017 ✓ — marginally acceptable, but the abstract and Section 4.1 headline round to two decimal places (`[−0.034, 0.031]`) for the baseline, creating inconsistent precision across the paper.

### [MAJOR] Suspicious permutation inference reporting (Section 5.1)
Text states: *"randomization inference yields a t-statistic of −5.999 with a randomization p-value of 0.434."* A t-statistic of |6.0| is extreme under any standard distribution; paired with a 43% randomization p-value, these numbers are inconsistent and require explanation or correction. Either the t-statistic is from the covariate-adjusted WLS model (where −0.027/0.0053 ≈ −5.1, not −6.0) or the permutation procedure was applied to a wrong specification.

### [MINOR] Notes (likely present but not visible in truncated content)
Cannot confirm whether notes define bandwidth selection method, inference procedure, or significance stars. This must be verified in the full file.

## TABLE 3 — Robustness Checks

### [CRITICAL] Nested `\begin{table}` float environment
Same structural defect — will not compile.

### [CRITICAL] `tablenotes` outside `threeparttable`
Same defect as Table 1.

### [CRITICAL] Code bug — donut-hole 0.5 and 1.0 are identical
Panel B rows for donut 0.5 and donut 1.0 show **identical** estimates, SEs, CIs, BW, and N:

```
0.5   -0.0014  0.0213  [-0.0388, 0.0449]  10.65  19434
1.0   -0.0014  0.0213  [-0.0388, 0.0449]  10.65  19434
```

Excluding ±0.5 and ±1.0 years from the cutoff necessarily produces different samples and different bandwidths. Identical results indicate a copy-paste error or code bug. **This cannot be published as-is.**

### [MAJOR] Column count mismatch
The tabular spec is `{l cccccc}` = 7 columns, but the header row supplies only 6 entries (`Test & Estimate & SE & 95\% CI & BW & N`). This is a silent alignment error; LaTeX will not throw an error but will pad an empty column, misaligning all cells.

### [MAJOR] Panel D — two "TIENE_BILLETERA" rows with no distinguishing label
Both placebo-cutoff rows are labeled "TIENE_BILLETERA" with no indication of which age is used as the placebo. The text (Section 5.2) says "Placebo cutoffs at age 53 (12 years below the true cutoff) and **age 53** (12 years right)" — the second occurrence of "age 53" is a **typo**; it should be age 77 (65 + 12). The table rows must be labeled, e.g., "Placebo cutoff: age 53" and "Placebo cutoff: age 77."

### [MAJOR] Text–table conflict on placebo CI
Section 5.2: *"The left placebo achieves a confidence interval that does not include zero."* Table shows CI `[−0.0083, −0.0062]` with SE `= 0.0006` — an implausibly tight standard error (~6× smaller than the primary outcome SE). This merits verification.

### [MAJOR] Panel D mixes outcome-placebo and cutoff-placebo tests
`INTERNET_HOGAR` and `SMARTPHONE` rows appear to test covariate discontinuities — the same test already performed in Table 4 (Balance). Including them again in Panel D under "Placebo" without labeling the distinction (covariate outcome vs. placebo cutoff) creates confusion and apparent duplication.

### [MAJOR] "H Double" bandwidth CI is inconsistent
Panel A row "H Double": Estimate −0.0204, CI `[−0.0272, 0.0264]`. The CI width is 0.053 at BW = 28.48. But the CI is not symmetric around the estimate: −0.0204 − (−0.0272) = 0.0068 on the left vs. 0.0264 − (−0.0204) = 0.0468 on the right. This asymmetry is expected with bias-corrected robust CIs, but the text (Section 5.2) says "all 95% confidence intervals overlapping zero" — this CI does overlap zero (lower bound −0.0272, upper bound +0.0264), so the statement is accurate, but readers should be told the CI is bias-corrected.

### [MINOR] Panel A labels
"H Half", "H Optimal", "H Double" should be expanded: e.g., "h*/2 = 7.12", "h* = 14.24 (MSE-optimal)", "2h* = 28.48" — the actual bandwidth values are already in the BW column so abbreviations are ambiguous without footnotes.

## TABLE 4 — Covariate Balance

### [CRITICAL] Nested `\begin{table}` float environment
Same structural defect.

### [MAJOR] Caption and label mismatch
- `.tex` file: `\caption{Covariate Balance at the Age-65 Eligibility Threshold (Within Bandwidth)}` / `\label{tab:cov_balance}`
- `main.tex`: `\caption{Covariate Balance at Age-65 Cutoff (RDD Estimates)}` / `\label{tab:balance}`

The `\ref{tab:balance}` in main.tex resolves to the outer float's label (correct), but the inner `tab:cov_balance` is orphaned and inconsistent.

### [MINOR] Asterisk notation defined but unused
Notes define `$^{*}$ 95% CI excludes zero` but no asterisks appear in the table body. Either add markers where warranted or remove the footnote symbol.

### [MINOR] Raw variable names
Same issue as Tables 1–2: `INTERNET_HOGAR`, `SMARTPHONE`, `POBREZA`, `INGRESO_PC`, `NIVEL_EDUCATIVO` should be human-readable labels.

### [MINOR] Text–table consistency
All three specific values called out in Section 5.3 cross-check correctly against Table 4 (±0.001 rounding tolerance). ✓

## FIGURES

### Figure 1 — RD Plot (`figure_1_rdplot.png`)

**Caption:** *"RDD Plot: Digital Wallet Ownership by Age. Binned scatter with local-linear fit on each side of the cutoff. The vertical line marks age 65. There is no visible discontinuity at the cutoff."*

**[MINOR]** Caption editorializes. "There is no visible discontinuity at the cutoff" is a conclusion, not a description. Move to body text.

**[MINOR]** No axis label information. Caption should state explicitly: X-axis = age in years; Y-axis = share of respondents owning a digital wallet (%).

**[MINOR]** Caption does not state whether confidence bands are displayed. Standard RD plots show 95% CI shading on the fit lines; if present, they must be mentioned.

**[MINOR]** Section 5.5 prose error: *"rates rise from approximately 4% at age 50 to a maximum of 11% near age 35."* This sentence describes age decreasing (50 → 35), which is backwards. Should read: *"rates decline from approximately 11% near age 35 to about 4% at age 50."*

### Figure 2 — Bandwidth Sensitivity (`figure_2_bandwidth_sensitivity.png`)

**Caption:** *"Bandwidth Sensitivity. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome (TIENE_BILLETERA) across bandwidth choices ranging from h*/2 to 2h*. The estimates are stable and confidence intervals consistently cover zero."*

**[MINOR]** Caption editorializes ("estimates are stable…"). Move to text.

**[MINOR]** `TIENE_BILLETERA` in caption should be replaced with "digital wallet ownership."

**[MINOR]** Axis labels absent from caption. Should specify: X-axis = bandwidth (years); Y-axis = RD estimate (percentage points).

**[MINOR]** Caption does not indicate whether the bandwidth axis is discrete or continuous, or how many points are shown.

### Figure 3 — McCrary Density (`figure_mccrary_density.png`)

**Caption:** *"Density of the Running Variable around the Age-65 Cutoff. The histogram displays the empirical density of age in the sample. While integer-age mass points are visible (a feature of self-reported age in years), there is no evidence of bunching specifically at age 65."*

**[MINOR]** Caption editorializes ("there is no evidence of bunching"). Move to text.

**[MINOR]** Y-axis label absent: does the y-axis show counts, frequency, or estimated density?

**[MINOR]** Test statistic and p-value (t = 2.0) are reported in the text (Section 5.2) but not in the caption or figure note. Self-contained figures should include these.

## ADDITIONAL CROSS-PAPER ISSUES

### [CRITICAL] Unresolved citation placeholder — Section 2.3
*"[CITATION MISSING — insert \citet{} key]"* appears verbatim in the literature review. This will be visible in the compiled PDF.

### [MAJOR] Bibliographic year inconsistencies in `thebibliography`
- `\bibitem[Ardington et~al.2009]{ardington2016}`: Author-date label says **2009** but the cited article is *AEJ: Applied Economics* **8(1):22–48, 2016**. The label prefix must match the publication year.
- `\bibitem[Banerjee et~al.2019]{banerjee2020}`: Label says **2019** but the *Annual Review of Economics* paper is listed as **2020** everywhere else. These inconsistencies affect `natbib`'s author-year rendering.

### [MAJOR] Text cites `\citet{deming2023}` for "age gradient in technology adoption"
The actual Deming & Noray (2023) paper studies *earnings dynamics and STEM careers* — not technology adoption by elderly populations. This appears to be a misattributed citation.
