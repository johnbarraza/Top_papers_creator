## CODE ISSUES (require re-running scripts)

These issues require modifying Python scripts and re-executing them.
After fixing scripts, re-run ALL scripts to regenerate results,
then update main.tex with the new numbers.

## MAY-ADDRESS (polish)

1. [Style] MAJOR (unresolved from Round 2): 'centred'/'centered' inconsistency throughout — standardize to Amer
2. [Style] MAJOR: Introduction calls the design 'a sharp regression discontinuity' despite the paper explicitly
3. [Style] MAJOR: Circular self-reference in §4 — 'As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:strategy}' appears within t
4. [Style] MAJOR: Limitations section promises five items but delivers two with bold headers and three as unlab
5. [Style] MAJOR: Abstract phrase 'other age-65-specific changes on the running variable' is ambiguous — revise
6. [Style] MAJOR: §1 missing words — 'an ITT estimate of institutional access on digital adoption' should read 

## REFEREE QUESTIONS (must answer in revised paper)

1. Why was the Kolesar-Rothe (2018) honest CI procedure not applied given that age is a discrete integer-valued running variable? How do the CIs change under that correction?
2. The covariate-adjusted estimate (-0.027) differs from the local-linear baseline (-0.006) by 21 percentage points — can you plot the bandwidth-sensitivity curve for the unadjusted estimator and show that this gap is entirely attributable to the wider bandwidth?
3. Using the 30% administrative coverage figure, what is the implied LATE under a 2SLS scaling, and is it still economically negligible?
4. Do AFP-related retirement transitions co-occur at age 65 in your ENAHO sample, and if so, how do you separate that effect from the Pensión 65 ITT?
5. Can you confirm and correct the template boilerplate in Table 1 footnotes and Figure 1 axis labels?
6. What is the minimum detectable effect at 80% power within your MSE-optimal bandwidth, and how does it compare to the effect size a policymaker would consider meaningful?
7. Does the null hold uniformly across urban and rural subsamples, or is it driven by a rural subpopulation with structurally near-zero wallet adoption?
