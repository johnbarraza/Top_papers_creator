# Editorial Decision: MAJOR_REVISIONS

**Score**: 51/100
**Fatal issues**: YES
**Round**: Round 1

## CODE ISSUES (require re-running scripts)

These issues require modifying Python scripts and re-executing them.
After fixing scripts, re-run ALL scripts to regenerate results,
then update main.tex with the new numbers.

1. [MUST] [Consistency] Donut-hole ±0.5 and ±1.0 produce identical estimates, SE, CI, BW, and N — clear code duplication bug
2. [MUST] [Consistency] McCrary density test statistic z=2.0 reported without p-value; p≈0.046 is borderline rejection of no
3. [SHOULD] [Contribution] Explain and decompose the covariate-adjusted point-estimate shift from -0.006 to -0.027
4. [SHOULD] [Contribution] Provide permutation distribution figure and reconcile t=-5.999 with randomization p=0.434
5. [SHOULD] [Contribution] Re-run descriptive statistics and robustness checks with official survey weights (FACPOB07)
6. [SHOULD] [Math] Right-side placebo cutoff printed as 'age 53' (should be age 77 = 65+12)
7. [SHOULD] [Tables/Figures] Table 3 Panel B: donut-hole 0.5 and 1.0 produce identical estimates — almost certainly a code bug
8. [SHOULD] [Referee Question] Is the bandwidth identical across the unadjusted and covariate-adjusted specifications? If so, what is the F-test for co
9. [SHOULD] [Referee Question] Which standard error yields t=-5.999 for the primary outcome, and can you show the full permutation distribution with th
10. [SHOULD] [Referee Question] What other programs or institutional changes activate at age 65 in Peru, and have you tested for discontinuities in labo
11. [SHOULD] [Referee Question] Why were ENAHO expansion factors excluded from the main estimates? Please show weighted and unweighted descriptive means

## TEXT ISSUES (edit main.tex)

These issues require editing the paper text only.

## MAY-ADDRESS (polish)

1. [Style] Unfilled citation placeholder '[CITATION MISSING]' left verbatim in Section 2.3 — must be resolved b

## REFEREE QUESTIONS (must answer in revised paper)

1. Can you show the first-stage RDD for Pensión 65 receipt (or Banco de la Nación account ownership) at age 65, either from ENAHO or administrative records?
2. Among the POBREZA=1 extreme-poor subsample — the only group for whom age 65 confers eligibility — what are the RDD estimates, and what is the MDE if the subsample is underpowered?
3. Is the bandwidth identical across the unadjusted and covariate-adjusted specifications? If so, what is the F-test for covariate balance within the bandwidth, and what is the theoretical mechanism for the point estimate shift?
4. Which standard error yields t=-5.999 for the primary outcome, and can you show the full permutation distribution with the observed statistic marked?
5. What other programs or institutional changes activate at age 65 in Peru, and have you tested for discontinuities in labor market participation or other potential confounders?
6. Why were ENAHO expansion factors excluded from the main estimates? Please show weighted and unweighted descriptive means and discuss sensitivity of the bandwidth to weighting.
