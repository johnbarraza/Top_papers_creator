## Mathematical & Formal Content Review — Round 3

### Preliminary Note: Critically Truncated Manuscript

The `main.tex` provided contains **only the LaTeX preamble and three bibliography entries.** The entire document body — title, abstract, all numbered sections, all equations, all tables, all figures — is absent. This makes it impossible to evaluate mathematical correctness, notation consistency, equation numbering, regression specification alignment, or statistical notation. The seven checklist items cannot be assessed on content that was not transmitted.

What is present: package declarations + 3 `\bibitem` entries + `\end{document}`
What is absent: `\begin{document}`, document body, most bibliography entries

The issues below are therefore structural LaTeX problems visible in the provided fragment.

### CRITICAL Issues

**[CRITICAL-1] Missing `\begin{document}` — document will not compile**

No `\begin{document}` command appears anywhere in the file. Every line after the preamble is effectively in the preamble. This is a fatal compilation error regardless of content.

---

**[CRITICAL-2] Missing `\begin{thebibliography}` — unmatched environment**

The file ends with `\end{thebibliography}` but contains no corresponding `\begin{thebibliography}{...}`. LaTeX will throw an unmatched `\end` error and halt.

---

**[CRITICAL-3] Jack & Suri (2014) `\bibitem` command accidentally commented out**

The comment block reads:

```latex
% natbib in authoryear mode requires a .bbl file. Since we use a manual
% thebibliography environment with \bibitem[Jack and Suri(2014)]{jack2014}
Jack, W. and Suri, T. (2014).
Risk Sharing and Transactions Costs: Evidence from Kenya's Mobile Money Revolution.
\textit{American Economic Review}, 104(1):183--223.
```

The `\bibitem[Jack and Suri(2014)]{jack2014}` invocation was placed on the second comment line and is therefore a comment, not a command. The entry body ("Jack, W. and Suri, T...") appears as raw floating text with no `\bibitem` anchor. Any `\cite{jack2014}` call in the text will resolve to `??`. The correct structure:

```latex
\begin{thebibliography}{99}

\bibitem[Jack and Suri(2014)]{jack2014}
Jack, W. and Suri, T. (2014).
Risk Sharing and Transactions Costs: Evidence from Kenya's Mobile Money Revolution.
\textit{American Economic Review}, 104(1):183--223.
```

### MAJOR Issues

**[MAJOR-1] Mathematical review is blocked — paper body not provided**

None of the seven checklist items (mathematical correctness, notation consistency, undefined notation, equation numbering, regression–text–table alignment, statistical notation, LaTeX math formatting) can be evaluated. The fragment provides nothing to check.

---

### Status of Round 2 Issues

| Issue | Status | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL-2: Deming & Noray phantom reference | **Apparently resolved** — entry absent from the three provided `\bibitem`s | Visible in fragment |
| MAJOR-5: Banerjee et al. year inconsistency | **Cannot verify** — entry not present in fragment | Truncation |
| CRITICAL-1: Figure 1 age-direction contradiction | **Cannot verify** — §5.5 body absent | Truncation |
| MAJOR-1 through MAJOR-6: prose issues | **Cannot verify** — body absent | Truncation |

---

### Recommendation

The file as transmitted is non-compilable and lacks the document body. Before any substantive mathematical review can proceed, the authors must supply the complete `main.tex` with:

1. A proper `\begin{document}` ... `\end{document}` wrapper
2. A properly opened `\begin{thebibliography}{99}` environment
3. The `\bibitem` command for Jack & Suri (2014) removed from the comment

Once the full document body is available, the mathematical checklist — derivations, regression specifications, notation, equation numbering — can be evaluated properly.
