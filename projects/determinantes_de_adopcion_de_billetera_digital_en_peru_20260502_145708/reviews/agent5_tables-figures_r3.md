The figure files are binary PNGs — I'll base the figure review on structural checks (captions, cross-references, axis labels) derivable from context, flagging what requires visual verification. Here is the full production-editor report.

## TABLES

### Table 1 — Summary Statistics

**[CRITICAL-T1-1] Phantom "---" columns render the table malformed**

The column spec is `l cccc cccc` — eight data columns per group — but the 4th and 8th columns are headed `---` and every data cell in those positions also reads `---`. No note explains what these columns represent. A table submitted to a journal with literal `---` headers will fail copyediting unconditionally. Either:

- Populate them with real data (e.g., p-value of the cross-group difference, Min, or Max), or
- Remove them entirely and trim the spec to `l ccc ccc`.

---

**[MAJOR-T1-1] All row labels are raw database-variable names**

Every row uses an all-caps code identifier (`TIENE_BILLETERA`, `USA_BILLETERA`, `INTERNET_HOGAR`, `SMARTPHONE`, `POBREZA`, `INGRESO_PC`, `NIVEL_EDUCATIVO`). Journal style requires human-readable labels, e.g.:

| Code | Suggested label |
|---|---|
| `TIENE_BILLETERA` | Owns digital wallet |
| `USA_BILLETERA` | Uses digital wallet |
| `INTERNET_HOGAR` | Internet access at home |
| `SMARTPHONE` | Smartphone ownership |
| `POBREZA` | Poverty classification (SISFOH) |
| `INGRESO_PC` | Per capita income |
| `NIVEL_EDUCATIVO` | Education level |

---

**[MAJOR-T1-2] NIVEL_EDUCATIVO missing-observation gap not explained**

`NIVEL_EDUCATIVO` reports N = 13,793 (treated) and 92,826 (control) against group totals of 14,088 and 99,667. The ~295 treated and ~6,841 control missing observations are mentioned nowhere in the note or paper body. The table note must state the reason (e.g., "NIVEL_EDUCATIVO is missing for respondents who did not complete the education module; listwise deletion applied").

---

**[MAJOR-T1-3] INGRESO_PC values reported without units**

Mean values of 13,454 and 11,417 carry no currency, price-year, or frequency label. Specify in the row label or note: e.g., "Per capita income (monthly, 2024 PEN)" or "annual real soles."

---

**[MINOR-T1-1] Full-sample vs. estimation-sample comparison risks misreading**

Treated N = 14,088 and control N = 99,667 span the full dataset, while all causal estimates use the bandwidth-restricted sample (N = 27,809). The note does flag this, but consider adding a bracketed subtitle under the table title — e.g., "*Full sample (not bandwidth-restricted; estimation sample: N = 27,809 within h\* = 14.24)*" — so the distinction is visible before a reader reaches the note.

---

### Table 2 — Main Results

**[MAJOR-T2-1] Software package names used as method descriptors**

The `Method` row displays `rdrobust` and `statsmodels_WLS`. These are implementation names, not econometric descriptions. Replace with:
- `rdrobust` → "Local linear RD (rdrobust)"
- `statsmodels_WLS` → "Parametric WLS regression"

---

**[MAJOR-T2-2] Section-group headers contain underscores**

Row-group headings `baseline`, `with_covariates`, and `extended_covariates` are rendered verbatim with underscores. Typeset as: *Baseline*, *With covariates*, *Extended covariates* (italic or small-caps, matching journal house style). Underscores suggest the code label was inserted without editing.

---

**[MAJOR-T2-3] Unexplained "---" in the SISFOH heterogeneity panel, USA\_BILLETERA column**

All three SISFOH subgroup rows (extreme-poor, non-extreme-poor, non-poor) show `---` under `USA_BILLETERA`. It is unclear whether the analysis was not run, failed to converge, or is simply omitted for space. The table note must state: "Heterogeneity by SISFOH poverty classification was estimated for TIENE\_BILLETERA only; the subgroup samples are too small for a precise estimate of USA\_BILLETERA."  (Or supply the estimates if they exist.)

---

**[MINOR-T2-1] Absence of significance stars not declared**

Neither Table 2 nor any other table uses significance stars. This is a valid reporting choice, but it must be stated once — typically in the first results table note: "Significance thresholds are not starred; 95% confidence intervals are reported throughout." Without the declaration, production editors will query every results table.

---

### Table 3 — Robustness

**[CRITICAL-T3-1] Identical point estimates for H Half and H Optimal — suspected copy-paste error**

Panel A reports:

| Row | BW | N | Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| H Half | 7.12 | 14,803 | **−0.0056** |
| H Optimal | 14.24 | 27,809 | **−0.0056** |
| H Double | 28.48 | 50,989 | −0.0204 |

The bias-corrected point estimate from `rdrobust` at half-bandwidth (N = 14,803) being bit-for-bit identical to the estimate at full-bandwidth (N = 27,809) is nearly impossible in practice — local linear RD estimates change with sample composition. This overwhelmingly suggests the H Half row was copied from the H Optimal row. The SE and CI do differ (0.0221 vs. 0.0179; wider at smaller BW, which is directionally correct), but the estimate itself must be verified and corrected. **If Figure 2 (bandwidth sensitivity) displays these values, it must be regenerated after correction.**

---

**[MAJOR-T3-1] Bandwidth labels "H Half / H Optimal / H Double" are undefined**

"H" appears nowhere in the note or table header. Replace with notation that is self-defining: "0.5 × h\*", "h\* (baseline)", "2 × h\*" — or add to the note: "*H denotes the MSE-optimal bandwidth h\* = 14.24; Half and Double refer to 0.5h\* and 2h\*, respectively.*"

---

**[MAJOR-T3-2] Table 3 Panel D and Table 4 report the same covariate-balance test with different numbers — no explanation**

Both tables use pre-determined covariates as RD outcomes, but the specifications differ silently:

| | INTERNET\_HOGAR | SMARTPHONE |
|---|---|---|
| **Table 3 Panel D** | BW = 15.23, N = 29,668, SE = 0.0487, CI = [−0.0615, 0.1296] | BW = 14.29, N = 27,809, SE = 0.0246, CI = [−0.0218, 0.0748] |
| **Table 4** | BW = 14.24, N = 27,809, SE = 0.0489, CI = [−0.0607, 0.1308] | BW = 14.24, N = 27,809, SE = 0.0256, CI = [−0.0146, 0.0857] |

A referee encountering both tables will flag this as contradictory data unless it is explained. The most likely interpretation is that Table 3 Panel D uses each covariate's own MSE-optimal bandwidth, while Table 4 fixes the bandwidth at h\* = 14.24. Add to the Table 3 note: "*Panel D uses the covariate-specific MSE-optimal bandwidth; Table 4 reports the same test at the fixed baseline bandwidth h\* = 14.24.*" Add the mirror statement to Table 4.

---

**[MINOR-T3-1] Table note misleadingly says Donut ±0.5 "effectively coincides with the baseline"**

The note states: "*Donut ±0.5 effectively coincides with the baseline because EDAD is integer-valued.*" But the estimate shifts from −0.0056 (baseline) to −0.0001 (±0.5 donut) and N drops from 27,809 to 25,431 (a loss of 2,378 observations). This is not a coincidence; it removes everyone recorded at exactly age 65. Revise to: "*Because EDAD is recorded in integer years, the ±0.5-year donut is the smallest feasible exclusion window; it drops the 2,378 observations reported at exactly age 65.*"

---

### Table 4 — Covariate Balance

**[MINOR-T4-1] NIVEL\_EDUCATIVO N = 27,325 gap not noted**

All other covariates report N = 27,809. NIVEL\_EDUCATIVO reports N = 27,325 — 484 observations fewer. The note is silent on this. Add: "*NIVEL\_EDUCATIVO is missing for 484 observations within the estimation bandwidth.*"

---

**[MINOR-T4-2] Bandwidth distinction from Table 3 Panel D not stated**

As described in [MAJOR-T3-2] above, Table 4 should note explicitly that it uses the fixed h\* = 14.24 (not the covariate-specific optimal bandwidth used in Table 3 Panel D). One sentence in the note suffices.

---

## FIGURES

The figure files are binary (PNG/PDF) and could not be read programmatically. The following issues are flagged based on structural context and cross-referencing.

---

**[MAJOR-F1-1] Figure captions cannot be confirmed — main.tex body is absent from the submitted excerpt**

The `main.tex` provided is truncated: it ends at `\usepackage{threeparttable}` and then jumps directly into bibliography entries, with no `\begin{document}`, no `\begin{figure}` environments, and no `\caption{}` commands visible. It is therefore impossible to confirm that any figure has a caption. Production must verify that each figure environment includes:
- A complete, self-contained caption
- Identification of what is plotted (outcome, sample, bandwidth)
- The CI method (bias-corrected, robust)
- The data source

---

**[MAJOR-F1-2] Figure 1 (RD plot) — Round 2 logical-error correction not verifiable from submitted materials**

Round 2 flagged a direction inversion in the Figure 1 caption ("rates rise from approximately 4% at age 50 to a maximum of 11% near age 35"). The authors reportedly revised this, but the revised caption is not included in the materials submitted for Round 3. Confirm the corrected text reads consistently with the plotted data before accepting.

---

**[MAJOR-F1-3] figure\_mccrary\_density.png — in-text citation not confirmable**

A McCrary density-test figure exists but no `\begin{figure}` block referencing it appears in the truncated main.tex. Confirm: (a) it is assigned a figure number, (b) it is cited in the robustness section with a sentence reporting the test statistic and p-value, and (c) its caption states the null hypothesis being tested and whether it is rejected.

---

**[MINOR-F2-1] Figure 2 (bandwidth sensitivity) may need regeneration**

If [CRITICAL-T3-1] above confirms that the H Half estimate (−0.0056) is a copy-paste of the H Optimal estimate, any sensitivity plot that displays that value will also be wrong. Regenerate Figure 2 after the Table 3 Panel A correction.

---

## CROSS-TABLE CONSISTENCY

**[MINOR-X1] NIVEL\_EDUCATIVO missing-N pattern is internally consistent but undocumented across tables**

Table 1: 13,793 / 14,088 treated (missing 295); Table 4: 27,325 / 27,809 (missing 484). Both shortfalls are attributable to the same systemic missingness. Use identical phrasing in both table notes so the pattern reads as intentional and documented.

---

## SUMMARY COUNT

| Severity | Count | Location |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | 2 | Table 1 (phantom columns), Table 3 (identical estimates) |
| MAJOR | 9 | Tables 1–3 × 3 each; Figure captions + in-text citations |
| MINOR | 6 | Tables 1–4; Figure 2 regeneration |
